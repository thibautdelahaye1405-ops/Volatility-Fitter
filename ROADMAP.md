# Vol-Fitter — Development Roadmap

Implied-volatility fitter (à la VolaDynamics) with a differentiating feature:
**extrapolation of sparse smile observations to the full universe of smiles**
(across expiries and assets) by propagating signal through a graph whose nodes
are smiles `(underlying, T)`, using the OT-regularized Bayesian solver of
`Docs/ot_bayesian_graph_extrapolation_expanded.tex`.

## STATUS — updated 2026-06-14 (resume here)

**Done & verified (409 pytest tests green incl. 4 perf + 1 live-optional, `git log --oneline` tells the story):**

- **[2026-06-14] UX/viewer batch — theming, layout, zoom, true-coordinate axis,
  Forwards chart**:
  * **View tab + full theming** (7th top tab): a `state/viewSettings.tsx`
    provider (localStorage) drives `data-theme` on `<html>` + a CSS
    contrast/brightness filter on `#root`. Tailwind v4 compiles colour utilities
    to `var(--color-*)`, so `index.css` re-skins the whole palette per
    `[data-theme]` scope with **no per-component migration** — four schemes
    **Dark / Light / High-contrast / Warm** (dark's dim text tiers lifted to fix
    "too dimmed"). New `views/ViewSettingsViewer.tsx` (scheme picker + contrast /
    brightness sliders + expiry format + live preview). Chart hardcoded hexes
    routed through tokens so charts flip too. Light mode verified end-to-end.
  * **Options tab reorganized by theme** (`OptionsViewer` 307 lines): Model &
    hyperparameters (model + N/damping/cores, model penalties, the local-vol
    grid) · Calibration (fit target, haircut, quote weighting, band mid anchor,
    var-swap weight, normalize events, calendar weight, calibration penalties,
    graph prior) · Workflow & engine features · Spot-vol dynamics. FitSettings
    lifted into `state/useFitSettings.ts` so its controls span two cards sharing
    one draft; `HyperparamPanel`/`PenaltyCoefficients` are now controlled +
    group-aware; one **Apply** bar commits both `/settings/fit` + `/settings/options`.
    Shared controls extracted to `components/OptionsControls.tsx`.
  * **Calibration gauge** in TopBar `WorkflowControls` (progress bar + current
    item label while a job runs). **As-of dropdown split into date → time** for
    captured snapshots, **weekday-only** (no weekend captures). **Local-Vol
    expiry selector → dropdown** (parity with Parametric). **Universe tab**:
    Active set and Lit/Dark matrix side by side.
  * **Zoom on every chart** (`lib/useZoom.ts`: base-relative wheel-zoom +
    drag-pan + dbl-click/⌂ reset, zoom-out beyond data): Smile (x+y, x beyond
    data), Stacked densities (x), Stacked IV (x+y), 3D Surface (scene scale),
    LocalVol Smile, Density / Log-Q-density. The Smile brush is kept as the
    coarse control.
  * **Smile true-coordinate x-axis** (`SmileChart` rewrite): geometry is plotted
    in the SELECTED coordinate (ln(K/F) / strike / %ATM / Δ / normalized), so the
    smile genuinely reshapes when switching (delta runs high→low) — no longer a
    fixed log axis. `axisModes.axisDisplayTicks` ticks the display domain.
  * **Curves drawn to k ∈ [-1, 1]** (`service.model_curve` 241 pts, `surface`
    81 pts extended to ±1; brush/default `kMin/kMax` stay the OBSERVED range, so
    zoom/pan out reveals the wings). New `service.fill_nonfinite` keeps the
    extreme-wing arrays finite (NaN would serialize to JSON null). 4 grid tests
    updated to the new semantics.
  * **T / √T toggle** on `TermChart`, the Forwards chart, and `SurfaceMesh`
    (`lib/timeAxis.ts`); **Surface coarse k-brush** (shrinks the strike axis,
    Parametric + LV IV-surface).
  * **Forwards-curve chart** (`components/ForwardCurveChart.tsx`): active-forward
    curve + dashed dividend ex-date verticals (amount labels), click-to-add a
    dividend, slider/numeric to set the amount, Apply (PUT `/settings/market`;
    continuous tickers switch to discrete cash so manual divs bite). Verified
    live on a throwaway synthetic backend.
  * Hardened `chartScale.niceTicks` against a sub-ULP step on flat domains
    (was an "Invalid array length" infinite-push crash). No new backend tests
    (existing grid tests updated); frontend strict-TS build green.

- **[2026-06-14] Local-Vol (affine) workspace overhaul**: (1) the vertex grid +
  roughness (λ, ρ) are now GLOBAL hyperparameters in Options only (the LV
  workspace's own sliders are gone); the affine fit reads them directly and they
  are in its cache key. Strike-node max raised to 200; **time vertices default to
  the observed expiries** (`gridTNodes = 0` = auto, one per expiry; > 0 caps).
  (2) An **"Optimal size"** button (Options) sizes the grid to the observed quotes
  (`GET /fit/affine/{t}/optimal-size`: strike nodes ≈ avg quotes/expiry, capped to
  ~160 total vertices so the heavy LSQ stays tractable). (3) The lowest strike
  vertex is placed strictly **between the lowest and 2nd-lowest observed strike**
  (no vertex below the data) — `_lowest_vertex_x`. (4) **LV joins the trigger
  model**: a per-ticker affine calibrated-pointer freezes the surface and reports
  `stale` (a STALE chip in the LV header) until Calibrate; the read path
  (`affine_payload`) NEVER recalibrates synchronously (the affine LSQ scales with
  vertex count — SPY ~minute) — it bootstraps once then serves frozen. The global
  background **Calibrate job now includes each lit ticker's LV surface** as
  labelled work items (`"TICKER · LV surface"`) so progress covers them
  (`workflow.calibrate_all`, jobs take `(label, thunk)` items); fetch-options
  auto-calibrate rebuilds them too. `calibrate_affine_surface` is the force path.
  Frontend: `useAffine`/`useAffineView` drop the grid params (POST `{fitMode}`
  only). 5 tests updated for the trigger model + new affine-grid/optimal-size
  tests; live-verified on SPY (optimal-size 977 quotes/8 expiries → capped grid,
  arb-free fit).

- **[2026-06-14] Trigger-gated calibration workflow** (what calibrates, on what,
  when): calibration is now decoupled from input changes. **Stale model** — each
  node carries a CALIBRATED pointer (the fit-key + spot it was last calibrated at)
  on AppState; `service.fit_or_get` bootstraps one fit, then with
  `Options.autoCalibrate` ON refits on any input change (old behaviour) and OFF
  *freezes* the last fit, reporting `SmileData.stale=True` until an explicit
  Calibrate (`node_dirty`/`calibrate_node`; a per-ticker `data_version` in the fit
  key bumps on a fresh options fetch). The spot-move transport anchors on the
  *calibration* spot (`anchor_spot`), not the live snapshot. **Actions**
  (`api/workflow.py` + `routers/workflow.py`): `POST /fetch/spots` (probe live spot
  → transport, no refit), `POST /fetch/options` (refetch chains + auto-calibrate
  when enabled), `POST /calibrate` (BACKGROUND job over all lit nodes via
  `api/jobs.CalibrationJobs`, `GET /calibration/status` for progress + lit/stale
  counts), `POST /calibrate/{ticker}[/{expiry}]` (sync), `POST /priors/seed`
  (explicit prev-close → calibrate → save). **Backend scheduler**
  (`api/scheduler.py`, opt-in `create_app(enable_scheduler=True)`; serve.py turns
  it on): a daemon thread polls live spots every `spotPollSeconds` when
  `spotMode=realtime` and refetches chains every `optionsFetchMinutes` when
  `optionsFetchMode=auto` (then auto-calibrates if enabled); `GET /scheduler` gives
  modes + countdowns. New OptionsSettings fields `spotPollSeconds`,
  `optionsFetchMode`, `optionsFetchMinutes` (autoCalibrate/spotMode now wired, not
  stubbed). **Frontend**: `state/useWorkflow.ts` (polls status, edge-reloads all
  views on job-completion / backend RT spot move) drives TopBar `WorkflowControls`
  (Fetch spots / Real-time Spots · Fetch Options Quotes / auto-countdown ·
  Calibrate with progress + stale-count badge); a STALE chip on the Parametric
  header; a "Calibration & data workflow" Options card; `useSmile` owns a single
  view-refresh counter (`spotVersion`/`refreshViews`) threaded into every
  workspace's fetchers; `useSpot` slimmed to the manual slider (backend owns RT).
  13 new tests (stale model, workflow endpoints, scheduler ticks); live-verified
  over HTTP (stale↔calibrate↔fetch cycle, scheduler thread running).

- **[2026-06-14] Fast spot-move transport (no recalibration)** per
  `Docs/spot_move_vol_surface_note_updated.tex`: a spot change — the user sliding
  the spot level OR a real-time spot tick — refreshes the calibrated smile / term
  / LV-grid **analytically**, never refitting (full recalibration only on the
  explicit Calibrate button). New `volfit/dynamics/transport.py`: the SSR
  horizontal total-variance transport `w₁ᴿ(k)=w₀(k+R·h_T)` (recovers
  sticky-moneyness/strike exactly at R=0/1), the exact sticky-local-vol `ℓ_T(k,h)`
  displacement (R=2 double-skew), an optional finite-move ATM re-anchor, and the
  LV-grid node rule `Kᵢ¹=Kᵢ⁰e^{(1−R/2)h_t}` (`TransportedSlice` SmileModel +
  `transport_grid_logk/strikes`). `h_T` comes from the FORWARD per the note
  (multiplicative under continuous yield, additive `ΔF=ΔS·e^{rt}` under discrete
  cash divs, so h differs per expiry). Integration: AppState holds a per-ticker
  spot SHIFT + `spot_version` (NOT in the slice fit-cache key — the anchor stays
  warm and is transported on read); `service.fit_or_get` wraps the cached
  `_anchor_fit` with `transport_record` (new forward, quotes re-indexed to new
  moneyness k−h, transported slice as a DisplayFit so EVERY view — smile, term,
  surface, density, var-swap, table, and the Dupire `/localvol` extraction —
  follows). The affine Local-Vol surface transports at the `affine_payload`
  boundary (`affine_transport.py`: per-expiry smile transport + grid relabel),
  `spot_version` busting the two derived caches. New endpoints
  `GET/PUT /spot/{ticker}`, `POST /spot/{ticker}/calibrate` (re-anchor: clear
  shift + drop chain caches + refit at live spot), `GET /spot/{ticker}/live`
  (provider spot re-probe for RT polling; cheap Yahoo override). Frontend:
  `state/useSpot.ts` (debounced PUT, RT poll when Options.spotMode='realtime',
  `spotVersion` folded into every workspace's fetchers), the aside "Spot scenario"
  slider repurposed into a live `SpotPanel` (slider moves the surface +
  anchor→shifted readout + regime·R + Calibrate button). 25 new tests
  (engine golden + service integration + API); live-verified over HTTP
  (synthetic +3%: fwd ×1.03, ATM 21.87%→21.73%, LV grid recenters, calibrate
  restores). The graph universe deliberately still reads the un-transported LQD
  anchor.

- **[2026-06-14] Auto-calibrate Events (Term)**: a horizon drop-list (an expiry T)
  plus a Calibrate button solve — all at once — one candidate event before each
  expiry up to T so the event-time forward variance `Δw/Δτ` is as flat and
  monotone-increasing as possible with events as small and sparse as possible
  (`volfit/calib/event_autocalibrate`: bounded L-BFGS-B over per-interval extra
  days, jaggedness + asymmetric non-monotonicity penalty + L1/ridge, tiny events
  thresholded out, the first post-T interval anchors the tail). Events only move
  the weighted clock, so the optimizer targets the *dilated* forward variance (the
  real-time one is event-invariant). `POST /events/{ticker}/autocalibrate`
  installs the result as the shared calendar. 4 tests.

- **[2026-06-14] Event-weighted VARIANCE CLOCK**: events are now a real variance
  clock (not just term interpolation). Each calendar day weighs 1; an event adds N
  *extra equivalent days* to its day (`volfit/calib/weighted_time.py`); the smile
  is calibrated/quoted in weighted years τ. Total variance is price-derived (clock-
  invariant), so the working IV = √(w/τ) **drops when an event sits before the
  expiry** (verified exact: ATM 0.2187→0.1980 = ×√(T/τ)) — quote bands, ATM,
  var-swap, table, term and the Local-Vol reconstruction all follow. Dual clock:
  calendar `t` still drives discounting / forwards / de-Americanization / the
  maturity axis; `prepared.tau` drives every vol↔variance conversion. An Options
  **Normalize events** toggle (default off) rescales all days so the 1Y weight
  budget stays 365 — 1Y vols unchanged, events redistribute variance within the
  year (verified). `eventsEnabled` is the master switch; the per-ticker calendar +
  `eventsEnabled`/`normalizeEvents` are folded into the fit-cache keys. Event
  weight is now *extra days* (was years); the Term editor labels it "days" and the
  master on/off lives in Options (the local checkbox is gone). No events ⇒ τ = t,
  byte-identical to before. 11 new tests.

- **[2026-06-14] Variance-swap quotes (Smile · Term · Table, Parametric + Local
  Vol)**: gated by the Options "Variance-swaps" toggle. A node carries at most one
  var-swap quote (the var-swap is a single log-contract scalar per smile),
  model-independent and SHARED across the Parametric (LQD/SVI/sigmoid) and
  Local-Vol (affine) fits, with its OWN undo/redo/reset history separate from the
  option-quote edits (`volfit/api/varswap_session.py` + AppState registry +
  `varswap_version` in the fit-cache key). Adding a quote adds a soft calibration
  penalty pulling the model's own fair var-swap toward the quote
  (`volfit/calib/varswap.py`, vol-space residual `sqrt(u)·(σ_vs_model−σ_vs_quote)`):
  threaded into all three parametric calibrators (scipy numerical Jacobian, so no
  analytic gradient) and the affine surface fit (reusing its existing
  `VarSwapQuote`). **Perf gotcha**: LQD's `implied_w` solves a per-point root, so
  the generic replication made one fit ~158 s under the FD Jacobian — LQD now uses
  its exact closed form `LQDSlice.var_swap_strike()` (≈0.7 s, vs 0.087 s
  unpenalized); SVI/sigmoid keep the cheap arithmetic-curve replication. The
  penalty weight is `OptionsSettings.varSwapWeightPct` (% of the node's summed
  option-quote weights; default 10%), so the var-swap competes with the options at
  a chosen relative strength regardless of quote count; `varSwapEnabled` /
  `varSwapWeightPct` now bump the options version. New endpoints
  `POST /smiles/{t}/{e}/varswap[/undo|/redo]` (shared by both workspaces). `SmileData`
  /`AffineSmile` gain `varSwap: VarSwapInfo`; `TermPoint` gains the per-expiry
  quote. Frontend: reusable `VarSwapPanel` (entry + slider + Exclude/Undo/Redo/Reset,
  Options-gated), a horizontal teal line on the Smile & Local-Vol smile charts, a
  Table footer row, and a Term overlay (hollow teal rings, click a rung to edit +
  a per-expiry panel/ladder column). 10 new backend tests; strict-TS build green.

- **[2026-06-14] All calibration/optimization coefficients exposed in Options**:
  every previously-hardcoded calibration constant is now a tunable parameter
  (each default = the historical constant, so default fits stay byte-identical
  and all golden tests pass) and surfaced explicitly in the Options tab —
  **LQD** A_R soft-barrier centre/scale, **SVI** no-arb penalty weight + Lee-slope
  bound, **Multi-Core SIV** hat-amplitude ridge, the **band** mid-anchor weight
  (threaded through `band_residuals` into LQD/SVI/sigmoid/affine), the **affine**
  roughness ρ, and the **graph** prior strength κ + η/λ/ν. Added to FitSettings
  (per-model, bumps the settings version) and OptionsSettings (graph-prior
  defaults + gridRegRho). Frontend: a `PenaltyCoefficients` sub-panel (grouped by
  model, greyed off-family) in HyperparamPanel + a "Graph prior (defaults)"
  section in OptionsViewer; `useAffine`/`useGraph` seed ρ and κ/η/λ/ν from the
  Options defaults. 1 new test (coefficients reach the calibrators).

- **[2026-06-14] Phase 10 viewer refinements** (third request batch):
  * **Local Vol IV surface is now 3D** (not a heatmap): the 3D renderer was
    extracted from SurfaceChart into a presentational `SurfaceMesh`; SurfaceChart
    is a thin fetching wrapper and the LV "IV surface" sub-tab builds a (T×k→σ_IV)
    mesh from the reconstructed affine smiles and renders it through SurfaceMesh,
    matching the Parametric Surface.
  * **Global expiry-format toggle** (`lib/expiryFormat.formatExpiry`): five
    formats — `dd-mmm-yy`, `(dd)mmmyy` (**smart-day**: the day is shown only on
    non-3rd-Friday listings, so monthlies read "Dec26", weeklies "11Dec26"),
    `1.25y`, `15.0m`, `15m 0d`. One global preference via a lightweight
    `ExpiryFormatProvider` context (localStorage-persisted), a full selector in
    the Options "Display" card + a ↻ cycle toggle in the Parametric/Local-Vol
    headers, applied across the expiry dropdown, chart titles, Local-Vol
    chips/diagnostics, Forwards & Term ladders, the lit/dark matrix and the
    stacked-chart legends.

- **[2026-06-14] Phase 10 viewer refinements** (second request batch):
  * **Aside/header slimmed**: the Parametric expiry-class chips (D/W/M/Q/All) are
    gone (the Expiry dropdown lists every selected expiry); the aside keeps only
    diagnostics + the spot-scenario *slider* — the **dynamics regime moved
    entirely to Options** (Mny / Strike / LV / LV-grid / custom-SSR; backend
    `dynamicsRegime` widened to a string literal incl. `custom`), and the **model
    selector moved to Options** too (ModelPanel retired). `useSmile` sources the
    scenario regime from `/settings/options` and re-pulls it on reload, so an
    Options change propagates.
  * **Stacked views (Parametric)**: the single-node Density tab is replaced by
    **Stacked densities** — every selected expiry's risk-neutral density overlaid
    (all ≥ 0 ⇒ no butterfly arb), new `GET /smiles/{ticker}/densities`
    (model-aware; declared before `/{expiry}`). A **Stacked IV** tab beside
    Surface overlays **total variance** w(k)=σ²·T per expiry (the correct space:
    non-crossing ⇔ no calendar arb), from the existing `/surface` mesh. New
    zero-dep `OverlayCurvesChart` (maturity-graded).
  * **Local Vol IV surface**: the Surface sub-tab is now **LV surface**; a new
    **IV surface** sub-tab shows the reconstructed implied-vol heatmap (per-expiry
    affine smiles resampled on a shared intersection grid). `LocalVolHeatmap`
    generalized with a legend label.
  * **Lit/dark nodes**: per-(ticker,expiry) lit/dark designation on AppState
    (lit by default; lit = observed source, dark = extrapolation target),
    `GET /universe/lit` + `PUT /universe/lit/{ticker}[/{expiry}]`, `GraphNodeInfo`
    reports `lit`. New `LitDarkMatrix` in the Universe tab; `useGraph` seeds its
    observed set from the designation on load and persists toggles back, so the
    Universe and Graph tabs stay in sync. 11 new backend tests (options/custom,
    stacked-densities, lit/dark); strict-TS build green; endpoints live-verified.

- **[2026-06-14] Phase 10 — workspace restructuring (tabs, Forwards & Options)**:
  top tabs are now **Parametric · Local Vol · Forwards · Options · Graph ·
  Universe** (Smile → Parametric; Term-Structure is no longer a top tab).
  * **Parametric**: Term-Structure embedded as a chart sub-tab next to Density
    (`components/TermPanel.tsx`, reuses useTerm + TermChart; aside hidden on it);
    the standalone `TermStructureViewer` is retired. The aside is slimmed to its
    live per-node controls — new `ModelPanel` (smile-family selector that PUTs
    the *full* FitSettings so other fields survive) + ScenarioPanel.
  * **Local Vol**: Parametric-style sub-tabs Smile / Density / Term / Surface
    (heatmap) / Table, every view DERIVED from the calibrated affine LV surface.
    Backend `api/affine_views.py` reconstructs them from the cached fit (wrap
    each reconstructed (k,vol) smile in an interpolating SmileModel, reuse the
    Breeden-Litzenberger density / log-contract var-swap / Black-price pipeline);
    `POST /fit/affine/{ticker}/{density,term,table}` share the AffineFitRequest
    body → same cache key. Frontend `state/useAffineView.ts` (only the active
    sub-tab fetches) + presentational `LocalVolTable`.
  * **Forwards** tab (`views/ForwardsViewer.tsx`): per-ticker forwards table
    across the ladder (parity/theo/manual/active) + the per-expiry ForwardPanel
    reused verbatim; edits refit both Parametric & Local Vol via the forwards
    version. (ForwardPanel left the aside.)
  * **Options** tab (`views/OptionsViewer.tsx` + `state/useOptions.ts`): new
    global `OptionsSettings` (GET/PUT /settings/options on AppState; options
    version folded into the fit-cache key, bumped only by the calibration-
    affecting `calendarWeight`). Hybrid meta page: calibration defaults (reuses
    HyperparamPanel + fit-mode), engine toggles (arb-fix / events / var-swap /
    auto-load-prior), spot-vol dynamics default (regime + SSR), local-vol grid
    defaults, the **penalty catalogue** (descriptions + formulas verified
    against the calibrators, editable `calendarWeight`), and the stubbed
    workflow toggles (auto-on-demand calibration, real-time/static spot).
  * **Wiring (per the "wire cheap / stub new" decision)**: `calendarWeight`
    fully affects surface slice fits (threaded into calibrate_slice, tested);
    `useAffine` seeds the LV grid from Options (untouched-only) and `useTerm`
    seeds the events default. The remaining toggles (enforceCalendar,
    varSwapEnabled, dynamicsRegime/ssr, autoLoadPrior) are persisted global
    defaults surfaced in the UI — deeper per-view consumption is the Phase 10
    follow-up; auto-calibrate + spot mode stay stubbed. 10 new backend tests
    (`test_api_options.py` ×6, `test_api_affine_views.py` ×4); strict-TS build
    green; new endpoints live-verified on uvicorn (synthetic ALPHA: options
    round-trip, /term 4 points, /density 169 pts, /table 14 rows, F 87.80).

- **[2026-06-14] "Quantile" chart replaced by the log quantile density**: the
  Smile Viewer's distribution tab now plots the LQD model's own backbone,
  ℓ(u) = log q(u) = −log f_X(Q(u)) = −log(pdf) vs u (Docs/lqd_model_note.tex eq
  lqd_main), with the y-axis **capped at ymax = 2.5** (ℓ is a bowl that diverges
  at the tails; the divergent tails are clipped to the plot box). Computed
  frontend-side from the existing `density` array (so it follows the chosen
  model, like density/quantile already do — no backend change). Tab renamed
  Quantile → "Log Q-density" (`logqd` view), legend/hover/hint updated, SVG
  clipPath added. Frontend strict-TS build green.

- **[2026-06-13] Weighted RMS fit error in the diagnostics**: every calibrated
  smile now reports its RMS vol error using the active weighting scheme —
  `sqrt(sum u_i (sigma_model - sigma_mid)^2 / sum u_i)` over the edited quotes,
  with u_i the equal/TV-density weights actually used by the fit (pure helper
  `models.diagnostics.weighted_rms_vol`; `service.weighted_rms_error` gathers the
  displayed slice + scheme weights). New `SmileDiagnostics.rmsError` (decimal
  vol) shown as a "RMS error" % row in the Smile aside. 2 new tests.

- **[2026-06-13] Time-value density quote weighting (all models, per maturity)**
  per `Docs/iv_time_value_density_weights.tex`: new `volfit/calib/weights.py` —
  `w_i = max(TV_i, eps) * s_i / s_bar` where TV_i is the OTM quote's time value
  (its normalized forward option price, `otm_time_value`) and s_i is the 1-D
  Voronoi cell width in log-moneyness, so the *aggregate* weight density follows
  TV(x) with the strike oversampling divided out (dense regions down-, sparse
  wings up-weighted; uniform grid → w_i = TV_i exactly). New FitSettings
  `weightScheme` ("equal" = historical unit weights | "tv_density"; room for a
  third) drives `resolve_weights(scheme, k, w)` — mean-normalized so the
  data-vs-regularization balance is identical to equal weighting. Applies to
  EVERY model and EVERY fit mode: SVI/Sigmoid/LQD multiply the (IV-space)
  residual by sqrt(w), LV-affine folds sqrt(w) into the vega tolerance, and the
  band objective scales its violation+anchor by it too. Computed on the *edited*
  slice quotes (exclusions define the Voronoi cells, amends move TV). Refactor:
  `fit_weights`/`fit_band` removed; `surface_inputs` returns (iso, prepared) and
  weights/band are derived per slice at fit time. New "Quote weighting"
  segmented control in HyperparamPanel. 9 new tests incl. the note's exact
  5-quote golden example + uniform-grid benchmark + per-model effect.

- **[2026-06-13] Term-structure & local-vol now follow the chosen model too**
  (correcting an earlier overstatement that they "need" LQD): neither has a
  structural LQD dependency. **Term-structure** only reports per-expiry ATM vol /
  ATM total variance / var-swap — all model-agnostic and already computed for
  overlays — so `analytics.term_structure` now reads them from the *displayed*
  fit (bitwise-equal to GET /smiles' diagnostics for the same model).
  **Local-vol** (`GET /localvol`) is a Dupire extraction that only uses the
  `implied_w(k)` SmileModel interface, so it now extracts from the displayed
  surface (`displayed_slice`); the SSR scenario uses the displayed skew. Caveat
  documented: Dupire's denominator is ill-conditioned and assumes an arb-free
  smooth input — LQD/SVI are arb-free by construction, the signed MC-SIV cores
  can violate butterfly, in which case the extraction clips and the no-arb
  diagnostics flag it. Only the **graph universe** genuinely stays LQD (it needs
  exact ATM-orthogonal coordinates + Newton retargeting). Refactor: the
  `displayed_*` accessors moved to `api/displayed.py` (service.py back to 379
  lines); added `displayed_var_swap_w`/`displayed_max_iv_error`. 2 new tests.

- **[2026-06-13] Density / Quantile views now follow the chosen model**: the
  density chart was hard-wired to the LQD backbone (`record.result.slice`) even
  when SVI/sigmoid was displayed. Added a model-agnostic Breeden-Litzenberger /
  Durrleman-Gatheral density `numeric_density(slice_)` in `models/diagnostics.py`
  (`p(k) = g(k)/sqrt(2πw) e^{-d_-^2/2}` from `implied_w(k)` alone, FD w'/w'',
  pdf floored at 0 + renormalized for non-arb-free overlays). `density_payload`
  now uses the displayed slice's own density for a non-LQD overlay (LQD keeps its
  exact closed form; saved prior stays the LQD snapshot). Validated: integrates
  to 1, matches the exact LQD pdf to <0.4% over the central mass, and exactly
  reproduces the flat-smile Gaussian N(-a/2, a). 3 new tests. (Frontend already
  labels the curve "Current fit" — no UI change.)

- **[2026-06-13] Bid-ask / haircut band fitting objective for ALL models**:
  the band fit modes no longer fit |mid - model|; they penalize the model
  *leaving the quoted band* — `max(model-ask,0)^2 + max(bid-model,0)^2` — plus a
  small `MID_ANCHOR_WEIGHT=0.05` |mid-model| anchor (new `volfit/calib/band.py`:
  `resolve_band`/`band_residuals`). "haircut" tightens each side toward mid by a
  tunable `haircut` (default 0.5 vol pts = 0.005, clamped never to cross mid:
  `modified_bid=min(bid+h,mid)`, `modified_ask=max(mid,ask-h)`), replacing the
  old HAIRCUT_SHRINK weight factor. The hinge is monotone so each model keeps
  its native residual space: **SVI/Sigmoid** vol-space hinge, **LQD** vega-
  normalized price hinge (band vols → call-price edges), **LV-affine** price
  hinge with the analytic Jacobian preserved (subgradient 0 inside band;
  `OptionQuote` gained `price_lo`/`price_hi`). Band-only weighting (no inverse-
  spread on top — the band encodes the spread; `fit_weights` now returns unit).
  "mid" mode is byte-identical (golden tests untouched). `haircut` added to
  FitSettings + a "Haircut (vol pts)" control in HyperparamPanel; threaded
  through fit_or_get / surface / WS / display-overlay / affine fit
  (`apply_band_edits`/`edited_band`, aligned to quote edits). Fixed a latent
  calib/__init__ import cycle (lazy `surface` via PEP 562). 13 new tests
  (band core + per-model in-band/smoothing/outside-pull + LV band modes).

- **[2026-06-13] Multi-Core SIV ("sigmoid") model rewrite** per
  `Docs/Multi_Core_SIV_Technical_Note.tex`: the legacy 4-param monotone sigmoid
  is replaced by `v_R(z) = v_SIV(z;theta) + sum_r alpha_r B_{c_r,h_r,kappa_r}(z)`
  — a one-core SIV base (level/skew/convexity/asymmetric wings, 6 params) plus R
  signed **zero-wing hat kernels** (eq B-def) that reshape the body for WW /
  dual-hat smiles WITHOUT moving the Lee wing slopes (eq model-wing-preservation).
  `models/sigmoid/kernels.py` (Phi primitive, base SIV, hat B + derivatives,
  Durrleman/Gatheral g diagnostic), `sigmoid.py` (`MultiCoreSiv` SmileModel,
  `SigmoidSmile` kept as alias), `calibrate.py` (base fit → greedy hat seeding on
  residuals → bounded trf joint refine + amplitude ridge; cores capped so
  6+4R ≤ N). **R is a slider** (`nCores` on FitSettings, 0–6, the analogue of the
  LQD Legendre order) threaded through `build_display_fit`/service → a "SIV cores
  R" range control in HyperparamPanel (active only for the sigmoid family).
  Golden tests reproduce the note's Table 1 coefficients, RMSE (8.62e-4), feature
  table, min v (0.03824) and min g (0.1553) to published precision; the slider
  monotonically buys fit (WW smile: R=0 base 105 bp → R=3 0.4 bp). 14 sigmoid
  tests + 2 settings tests; ruff + strict-TS build green.


- **[2026-06-13] As-of (timestamp) selector under Data Source**: choose the
  observation time — **Live / Real-time**, **Previous Close**, a provider **EOD
  trading day** (~30 days), or a **captured intraday** snapshot replayed from the
  store. Everything re-prices because it all flows through
  `AppState.snapshot()`. Provider contract gained `AsOf` + `fetch_chain(as_of=)`
  + `historical_modes()`/`available_history()` (`data/provider.py`, default
  live-only). Bloomberg does eod/prev-close via `bdh` (`data/bloomberg_history.py`,
  narwhals long `ticker/date/field/value`; ~30 trading-day list); Massive does
  prev-close from the snapshot `day.close` (zero-spread); Yahoo/Synthetic
  live-only. AppState `set_as_of` clears chain caches + routes live(+auto-capture
  to VolStore, dedup ~60 s) / provider-EOD / captured-replay
  (`store.snapshot_at`); `data/store.py` gained `list_snapshots`/`snapshot_at`/
  `last_snapshot_ts`. `api/asof.py` + `routers/asof.py` (GET/POST /asof).
  Frontend `state/useAsOf.ts` + a TopBar "As of" dropdown (amber when
  historical). 7 new tests. Live-verified: Bloomberg eod 2026-06-11 fits a real
  historical SPY smile (ATM 16.27%).

- **[2026-06-13] In-app Data Source selector** (Yahoo / Bloomberg / Massive /
  Synthetic) with a per-source status light (green=real-time, amber=delayed,
  red=unavailable). `AppState` now holds a **provider registry** instead of one
  provider (`self.provider` is a property over `_active_source`);
  `set_active_source` switches at runtime — keeps the watchlist + custom expiry
  picks, clears data caches, refetches on the new feed (auto selections
  re-resolve lazily, custom picks intersect the new available list). Each
  provider gains a cheap `feed_status()` probe (`data/provider.py` default +
  yahoo/bloomberg/massive overrides; Massive's is two single-page GETs, never
  full pagination). New `api/datasource.py` (concurrent probing + 30 s TTL
  cache) + `routers/datasource.py` (GET /datasources, POST /datasource/{id}).
  `serve.py` registers ALL sources and auto-picks the best-reachable active one
  (bloomberg→yahoo→massive→synthetic; `VOLFIT_PROVIDER` forces one). Frontend
  `state/useDataSources.ts` + a TopBar dropdown selector with status dots;
  switching fires the session's refreshUniverse()+reload(). `restart.ps1` now
  brings all sources up by default (flags only force the active one). 13 new
  tests. Live-verified: lights = bloomberg green / yahoo amber / synthetic
  green / massive amber, switch + 404 work end-to-end.

- **[2026-06-13] Bloomberg + Massive market-data providers** (CLAUDE.md data
  layer; ROADMAP Phase 3 + "Next up" #2). Both implement the
  `OptionChainProvider` contract so the whole stack runs on them unchanged.
  * **Bloomberg** (`data/bloomberg.py` + `data/bloomberg_parse.py`): via xbbg
    against a live Terminal. `available_expiries` parses the OPT_CHAIN
    descriptor strings (one cheap `bds`, no per-contract `bdp`); `fetch_chain`
    bulk-`bdp`s only the selected expiries' contracts (liquid names list 1000s).
    Reads xbbg's **narwhals long-format** frames column-wise (they lack
    `index`/`itertuples`). Real `OPT_EXER_TYP` sets `exercise_style`.
    `search_symbols` uses the blpapi `//blp/instruments` service so the Universe
    picker resolves "Nvidia"/"NVDA" -> "NVDA US Equity" (Massive search hits
    `/v3/reference/tickers`); the picker is source-aware via the active provider.
    `dividend_schedule()` imports `DVD_HIST_ALL` (future-declared rows, else
    projects the trailing quarterly cadence forward) → seeded into per-ticker
    MarketSettings at startup (`serve._seed_bloomberg_dividends`).
    Live-verified: SPY 13 expiries, 1026 quotes, spot+american+forwards+divs.
  * **Massive** (`data/massive.py`): Massive.com = rebranded Polygon.io
    (`api.massive.com`, Bearer auth, `/v3/...`). `available_expiries` via the
    contracts reference; `fetch_chain` via the chain snapshot (last_quote
    bid/ask + day OHLC + OI + underlying price); `NOT_AUTHORIZED` →
    actionable `RuntimeError`. **The supplied key's tier DOES return snapshot
    quotes + spot**, so Massive is a fully-working fitter source today
    (live-verified: 32 expiries, spot 741.75, 291/366 usable mids).
  * **Massive IV overlay** (`api/routers/massive_iv.py`, GET
    /massive/iv/{ticker}): Massive's own American IV/greeks per contract as a
    read-only comparison (entitled without quotes). Frontend toggle in the
    Smile Viewer (`state/useMassiveIv.ts` + cyan OTM scatter on SmileChart).
  * Wiring: `serve.py`/`snapshot.py`/`restart.ps1` gain `bloomberg`/`massive`
    selection (`VOLFIT_PROVIDER`, `VOLFIT_MASSIVE_KEY`; `restart.ps1
    -Bloomberg`/`-Massive`). Shared `data/fieldmap.py` (price/int coercion,
    also adopted by yahoo). Optional `providers` extra in pyproject (xbbg,
    blpapi, httpx, yfinance — not in CI). 16 new offline tests (injected
    `blp_module` / `http_get`); both providers live-verified end-to-end.

- **[2026-06-13] Per-ticker expiry-depth/window selection**: the Universe tab
  now picks each ticker's expiries from the FULL provider list. Provider
  exposes `available_expiries` (cheap — Yahoo `Ticker.options`, no chain fetch;
  horizon raised to ~2Y) and `fetch_chain(ticker, expiries)` fetches only the
  selected rungs. `data/expiry_select.py`: buckets (0dte / weekly = M/W/F /
  monthly = 3rd Fri / quarterly / daily), the **default rule** (first 2 M/W/F
  weeklies >=2 days + first 2 monthlies + quarterlies <=18M; sparse ladders
  <=8 take all), and bulk-filter resolution. AppState gains per-ticker
  available/selected/mode (auto vs custom), lazily applied to watchlist
  tickers; selection changes re-fetch the chosen expiries (extracted to
  `api/state_universe.UniverseMixin` to keep state.py <400). Endpoints: GET
  /universe/{t}/expiries (full list + buckets + selected flags), PUT (set),
  POST .../reset (default rule). Named universes now persist per-ticker
  selection ("auto" re-resolves the rule, "custom" re-applies explicit picks).
  Frontend `ExpiryPicker.tsx` in the Universe tab: bulk chips (0DTE/Weeklies/
  Monthly/Quarterly/<=1Y/<=2Y/All) + per-expiry checkboxes + Reset; edits
  refit every workspace via the shared session. 11 new tests; verified
  end-to-end on live SPY (29 available -> 8 default-selected; picker + chips).

- **[2026-06-13] Universe-selection UI**: a dedicated "Universe" tab (5th
  workspace) to curate the working set of underlyings. Backend: AppState now
  holds a mutable active-ticker set (`add_ticker` validates by fetching the
  chain + a parity forward, `remove_ticker` keeps >=1 and drops the ticker's
  caches, `set_active_tickers` for loading a saved set); `snapshot()` gates on
  the active set so dynamically-added symbols work. Symbol search
  (`provider.search_symbols`: default substring+echo, **YahooProvider override
  hits Yahoo's autocomplete** via httpx with offline fallback). New endpoints
  (`api/universe_service.py` + router): GET /universe (active), GET
  /universe/search, POST/DELETE /universe/tickers, and named universes wired to
  the existing SQLite persistence (`data/universe.py`) — GET/POST/DELETE
  /universes + POST /universe/load/{name} (no-op without VOLFIT_DB). Frontend:
  `views/UniverseManager.tsx` + `state/useUniverse.ts` (debounced search,
  add/remove, save/load/delete named) + `useSmile.refreshUniverse()` so edits
  propagate to every workspace's selectors. 7 API tests; verified end-to-end in
  headless Edge (search → add DELTA → save named universe).

- **[2026-06-13] Discrete cash-dividend de-Americanization**: the proper cure
  for the residual ATM kink on dividend-straddling expiries (the continuous-
  yield de-Am smears a discrete cash dividend into an average yield and
  mis-models the call/put early-exercise asymmetry near the ex-date). New
  escrowed-Hull cash schedule in the CRR tree (`core/american.py`: `_escrow` +
  `div_times`/`div_amounts` on `binomial_price`/`_batch`/`deamericanize`/
  `_batch`; recombining, base lattice on S-PV, actual spot = lattice + remaining
  dividend PV). Consistency: the tree uses the ticker's physical `rate` and the
  schedule's ex-date timing, with cash amounts SCALED so the escrowed forward
  reproduces the resolved forward exactly (`data/dividends.forward_consistent_
  cash_schedule`, alpha=(S-F e^{-rt})/PV) — the IV level is untouched, only the
  ex-date EEP asymmetry is corrected. Wired opt-in through quote prep
  (`api/quotes.prepare_quotes` + state `cash_dividend_schedule`): activates when
  the ticker has a discrete/mixed dividend mode with a cash leg in (0,t] and a
  rate high enough to admit positive dividends (else falls back to continuous-q,
  unchanged). Golden test: flat-vol American chain with a mid-period cash
  dividend — continuous-q leaves a 62 vol-bp ATM kink, discrete de-Am brings it
  to 1.5 bp and recovers the flat 20% smile (tests/test_discrete_deam.py).

- **[bugfix 2026-06-13] American parity-forward ATM kink**: put-call parity is
  an equality only for European options, so a forward implied from raw American
  C - P is biased (~40 bp), and quote prep then de-Americanized OTM puts/calls
  under that biased carry in opposite directions → a visible IV jump at the
  money (reproduced flat-vol: 93 vol bp; live SPY: 22-308 bp per expiry). Fix in
  `data/forwards.py`: when a reference date is supplied for an American snapshot,
  de-bias **only the forward** (iterating the carry q via de-Americanized
  European-equivalent mids to the fixed point that reconciles the two OTM sides)
  while **holding the discount at its raw parity value** — re-implying the
  discount (the fragile regression slope) drifted to absurd rates on short-dated
  / dividend chains and shifted the IV level through 1/(D F). Threaded
  `reference_date` through `implied_forwards` (api/state, snapshot.py); coarse
  near-ATM de-Am keeps it ~0.1 s/expiry (cached). Live SPY now joins smoothly
  across ATM with sane discounts. Discrete-dividend chains can keep a small
  residual kink (continuous-yield tree); **now cured opt-in by discrete cash-
  dividend de-Americanization — see the dated entry above**.
  4 golden tests (tests/test_forward_debias.py).
- Phase 0 scaffold (no CI yet), Phase 1 complete (LQD engine reproduces both
  paper benchmarks; ATM-orthogonal coordinates with exact Newton retargeting).
- **Phase 2 complete**: calendar constraint = elementwise asset-share
  comparison; local-vol grid model done (`models/localvol/`): bilinear/pw_t
  grid, Crank–Nicolson Dupire forward PDE pricer (adaptive 7.5-sd mesh,
  <0.5 vol bp flat round trip in ~20 ms), Dupire extraction with butterfly
  gating, no-arb diagnostics. Not yet exposed via the API.
- Phase 3 near-complete (M3 reached): synthetic + **Yahoo provider**
  (`data/yahoo.py`, yfinance, sqrt-time expiry thinning, 0-bid→None mapping),
  parity forwards, SQLite VolStore, snapshot CLI (`backend/snapshot.py`).
  Live-verified 2026-06-12: SPY/QQQ/AAPL chains fitted end-to-end in the UI
  (SPY 5.5M: ATM 17.2%, skew -0.41; clean monotone variance term structure).
  Run live: `$env:VOLFIT_PROVIDER='yahoo'; $env:VOLFIT_TICKERS='SPY,QQQ,AAPL'`
  before serve.py. (Bloomberg/Massive providers + DuckDB/Parquet history TODO)
- Phase 4 complete (dense path): 6-node golden example reproduced exactly;
  smile-universe round trip works (graph posterior on (atm_vol, skew, curv)
  handles → exact arbitrage-free LQD smiles + credible bands); 1k nodes < 1 s.
  Matrix-free/Hutchinson large-N path deferred to Phase 9.
- Phase 5 core: FastAPI backend live (`volfit/api`): /universe, /smiles
  (3 fit modes, prior save), /fit/surface (POST + WebSocket per-expiry
  progress), /graph/solve (12-node universe), /scenario/ssr. Quote prep with
  parity normalization + 4-sd wing filter (`api/quotes.py`). Run it:
  `.venv\Scripts\python backend\serve.py` (port 8000, CORS for Vite).
- Phase 5 fit sessions: per-(ticker, expiry) quote edits (exclude/include/
  amend/reset) with bounded undo/redo (`api/session.py`), instant refit via
  POST /smiles/{t}/{e}/edits|undo|redo; edits shared across fit modes via a
  version-stamped fit-cache key.
- Phase 6 partial: SmileViewer wired to the live API (`state/useSmile.ts` +
  `state/smileSession.tsx` context): universe-driven selectors, fit-mode
  refetch, mock fallback when offline, TopBar live/mock/connecting status.
  Quote interaction done: click-select quotes, Del exclude/restore, arrow-key
  mid amend (Shift = coarse), Ctrl+Z/Y undo/redo, excluded quotes dimmed,
  amended mids amber (drag-to-amend not implemented; keyboard-first per spec).
- Phase 7 core: Graph Viewer live (`views/GraphViewer.tsx` + `useGraph.ts` +
  `GraphChart.tsx`): SVG lattice (tickers × expiries, calendar/cross edges),
  click to light nodes, per-node dAtmVol inputs, η slider, solve via
  /graph/solve (+ new GET /graph/nodes baseline endpoint), shift coloring +
  sd halos + tooltips, double-click drills into the Smile tab. Verified in
  headless Edge (screenshots: 2 observed → 10 extrapolated, sane decay).
- Phase 6 near-complete: Term-Structure view live (POST /term + `useTerm` +
  `TermChart`: vol & variance vs T, real/event-dilated clock toggle, editable
  event markers, expiry ladder table); density & quantile chart views
  (GET /smiles/{t}/{e}/density + `DistributionChart`, prior overlay once
  saved); Save-prior button (priors now store LQDParams via `PriorRecord`).
- Phase 8 complete: SSR scenario engine + frontend regime selector
  (Mny/Strike/LV) with spot-return slider and dotted overlay on the smile
  chart. (true sticky-local-vol-grid mode still awaits localvol API wiring)
- API slice fits use gentle high-order damping (default REG_LAMBDA=1e-6) —
  without it, slices left with ~7 quotes after the wing filter interpolate
  exactly with wild handles (GAMMA 1M fitted skew +0.78). Now user-tunable:
  **fit-settings hyperparameters** (GET/PUT /settings/fit: nOrder, regLambda,
  regPower) held on AppState with a settings version folded into every
  fit-cache key; HyperparamPanel in the Smile Viewer aside drives it.
- **[REQ done] Piecewise-affine local-variance calibration** per
  `Docs/piecewise_affine_local_variance_calibration.tex`:
  `models/localvol/affine.py` (P1 hat-function surface; **scipy Delaunay
  triangulation reproduces the note's quote table to every published
  decimal** — fixed-diagonal splits land ~2e-5 off; implicit-Euler forward
  Dupire in normalized strike with analytic multi-RHS forward sensitivities)
  + `affine_calib.py` (option + var-swap LSQ per eq. calibration_objective;
  log-contract replication; second-difference roughness **lambda=50**
  reproduces the note's calibrated nodal table to 1.5e-3 and all fit
  metrics). 10 golden tests in tests/test_localvol_affine.py.
- **Local-vol grid exposed via API** (`api/localvol.py`, GET /localvol/{t}):
  pw_t forward-variance buckets extracted at bucket midpoints from the
  fitted surface, session/settings-aware cache, no-arb diagnostics in the
  payload. **Sticky-local-vol-grid SSR regime** (exact: grid fixed in
  absolute strike, Dupire reprice, realized SSR reported; "LV grid" button
  in ScenarioPanel). Caveat documented in api/localvol.py: the shortest
  bucket's ATM slope is ill-conditioned (bp-level fit wiggles amplified by
  the small-w Dupire denominator) — realized short-expiry SSR can sit well
  below the theoretical ~2; mid/long buckets land in 1.5-2.5.

- **Realism block, part 1 done**: `core/american.py` (CRR binomial
  American/European pricer + `deamericanize()` → European-equivalent IV by
  Brent inversion) and the **stale parity-pair filter** in `data/forwards.py`
  (iterative 4-robust-sigma MAD trim floored at 1bp of spot, `n_outliers`
  reported).
- **[REQ done] Realism block, part 2 (complete)**:
  * **Dividends model** (`data/dividends.py`): continuous yield / discrete
    absolute (escrowed) / discrete proportional / mixed (cash near-dated
    switching to proportional past `switch_years` — desk practice);
    `theoretical_forward()` + `equivalent_yield()`, golden-tested.
  * **Forward mode per expiry** (`api/market.py`, `routers/forwards.py`):
    parity-implied (default) / theoretical (rate + dividend model, per-ticker
    `MarketSettings` via GET/PUT /settings/market/{ticker}) / manual override
    — GET /forwards/{ticker} shows all three side by side, PUT
    /forwards/{t}/{e} sets the policy; a `forwards_version` on AppState is
    folded into every fit-cache key so policy changes refit cleanly. Frontend
    `ForwardPanel` in the Smile Viewer aside (mode segmented control, manual
    input, carry r/q inputs); verified in headless Edge (manual override
    89.56 vs parity 87.80 refits the smile end-to-end).
  * **De-Americanization wired into quote prep** (`api/quotes.py`):
    `ChainSnapshot.exercise_style` flag (Yahoo heuristic: `^`-prefixed
    indices European, stocks/ETFs American; VolStore schema v2 persists it);
    American mids inverted via vectorized-bisection `deamericanize_batch`
    (one (n_quotes × steps) CRR sweep per iteration — chain-scale, ~50 ms vs
    seconds scalar), early-exercise premium subtracted from bid/mid/ask alike
    (spread preserved in price space); carry derived from the resolved
    forward (r = -ln D/t, q = r - ln(F/S)/t). Golden round trip: CRR-priced
    American chain at known σ(k) recovered within 30 vol bp.

- **[REQ done] Chart & UX block (2026-06-13)**:
  * **Strike-axis modes** on the smile chart (`lib/axisModes.ts` +
    SmileChart): k / fixed strike / %ATM / delta (numeric-bisection inverse,
    "25Δ"-style ticks) / normalized / log-normalized — geometry stays in
    k-space, only ticks/crosshair labels transform; selector in the chart
    header.
  * **3D vol-surface view** (`components/SurfaceChart.tsx`, zero-dep SVG:
    painter-sorted quads, drag-to-rotate yaw, vol colormap + legend) fed by
    GET /surface/{ticker} (`api/surface.py`: shared 61-pt union k grid over
    the fitted ladder, cached slice fits).
  * **Table export**: GET /smiles/{t}/{e}/table (JSON) + /table.csv
    (attachment download; `api/table.py`, prices reconstructed via
    normalized Black) and a Table chart-card view (`QuoteTable.tsx`) with
    Copy-TSV / CSV-download.
  * **Expiry classification** (`data/expiries.py`: leaps > quarterly >
    monthly (3rd Friday) > weekly (Friday) > daily; `expiryType` on
    /universe) + class filter chips next to the expiry selector (only
    classes present render; auto-reselects when the current rung filters
    out). **Full universe-selection UI now done** (the Universe tab: provider
    symbol search, add/remove, named universes); the chips still cover bulk
    expiry selection within a ladder.
  * SmileViewer split into UniverseHeader / SmileAside / useSmileShortcuts
    to stay under the 400-line policy. All verified in headless Edge
    (surface mesh, delta ticks, table grid, CSV Content-Disposition).

- **[REQ done] Fit time-series scaffold (2026-06-13)**: every calibrated
  slice (POST/GET/WS paths alike) persists into the VolStore `fits` table
  keyed by SNAPSHOT timestamp (`api/history.py`: fresh WAL connection per
  write for thread safety, dedupe on (ticker, expiry, ts, fitMode),
  exception-safe — persistence can never fail a fit; opt-in via env
  `VOLFIT_DB=path`, off by default). Query: GET /history/{ticker}/{tenorDays}
  ?fit_mode= — per snapshot picks the expiry nearest the tenor, returns
  {ts, expiry, t, atmVol, skew, curvature, varSwapVol, maxIvErrorBp,
  forward} ascending. Charting UI deferred.

- **[REQ done] CI + perf benchmarks (2026-06-13)**:
  * **GitHub Actions** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): three jobs — `backend`
    (py3.11/3.12 matrix: `ruff check .` + `pytest -m "not live and not perf"`),
    `perf` (single 3.11 runner: `pytest -m perf -s`), `frontend`
    (`npm ci` + `npm run build` strict-TS gate). Per-branch `concurrency`
    cancels superseded runs; pip + npm caches keyed on lockfiles.
  * **Perf budget suite** (`tests/test_perf.py`, `@pytest.mark.perf`): a
    `BUDGET_MS` table enforced by warmup-then-median timing of the four hot
    paths — LQD slice fit (~95 ms local), 1k-node graph update (~700 ms),
    local-vol CN forward solve (~20 ms), ~80-quote de-Am batch (~630 ms);
    budgets sit ~2.5-3.5x above local medians for slow-runner headroom.
  * Registered `perf`/`live` pytest markers + a `test` extra (httpx, pandas)
    in pyproject; tagged the live Yahoo test `@pytest.mark.live`; cleaned the
    6 pre-existing ruff findings so lint gates clean. Generated
    `frontend/package-lock.json` for reproducible `npm ci`.
    (process-pool for parallel slice fits still deferred — single fit ~95 ms,
    instant-refit target already met.)

- **[REQ done] Graph Viewer remainder (2026-06-13)**:
  * **Full solver panel**: GraphSolveRequest now carries the prior knobs —
    kappaScale (local stiffness), etaScale (reach), lambdaScale (OT flux, 0 =
    off, preserves the legacy regime), nu (source allowance) — plus
    calendarWeight/crossWeight edge overrides. Wired in the new
    `api/graph_service.py` (extracted from service.py to keep both under the
    400-line policy): `_reweighted_universe` rebuilds only the cheap graph from
    the cached handles when weights change; `_build_priors` applies the scales
    per handle coordinate. SolverPanel.tsx (η/κ log sliders, λ slider, ν +
    edge-weight inputs) drives it via useGraph; default solve unchanged.
  * **Auto-tune η** (POST /graph/autotune, `autotune_graph`): leave-one-out
    cross-validation over the lit observations across a geometric η grid,
    minimizing held-out ATM-vol RMSE; returns the chosen η + scored grid
    (rendered as bars in the panel, ≥2 lit nodes required).
  * **Lasso selection** in GraphChart: drag a rectangle on the lattice
    background to light every enclosed node (node groups stop mousedown so a
    plain click still toggles). 7 new graph API tests; verified end-to-end in
    headless Edge (lasso lit all 12 nodes, solve propagated, auto-tune adopted
    η=10×).

- **Model choice in the hyperparameter panel (2026-06-13)**: the Smile
  Viewer can now fit the displayed smile with **LQD** (default, arbitrage-free
  quantile density + the analytic backbone), **SVI** (raw-SVI own calibration,
  new `models/svi_jw/calibrate.py`: reparametrized LM fit, data-driven init,
  soft Lee-wing + min-variance no-arb penalties; recovers the note's SPX
  benchmark to machine precision — 7 golden tests) or **sigmoid** (existing
  `calibrate_sigmoid`). LQD is *always* fitted under the hood; a non-LQD choice
  attaches a `DisplayFit` overlay (`api/fit_models.py`) read by the smile
  chart, diagnostics, quote table, 3D surface and SSR scenario, while density,
  term-structure, local-vol and the graph universe stay LQD-based (they need
  the exact LQD coordinates). Overlay diagnostics (ATM handles, var-swap by
  log-contract replication, Lee wing slopes) come from the new model-agnostic
  `models/diagnostics.py` (matches the LQD closed forms on an LQD slice — 4
  tests); A_L/A_R report 0 (no endpoint-scale analogue off LQD). FitSettings
  `model` is now `lqd|svi|sigmoid`; the LQD-only N/damping knobs grey out off
  LQD in HyperparamPanel. Frontend strict-TS build green.

- **Direct local-vol-affine fit + Local Vol view (2026-06-13)**: the
  model-choice bullet is now fully closed. `POST /fit/affine/{ticker}`
  (`api/affine_fit.py` + `schemas_affine.py` + `routers/affine.py`) calibrates
  the piecewise-affine local-VARIANCE surface of the Docs note straight to a
  ticker's option quotes — gathers every expiry's edited quotes, converts mid
  IVs to normalized forward call prices with vega-scaled tolerances, builds a
  tensor vertex grid (0 + a spread of expiries × a strike grid incl. x=1) and
  the fine PDE x/t grids (t hits every quoted expiry), runs
  `calibrate_affine`, and reconstructs each expiry's arbitrage-free smile by
  inverting the Dupire PDE call prices through Black. Distinct from
  GET /localvol (Dupire *extraction* from the LQD fit). Cached per request
  hyperparameters. New frontend **Local Vol tab** (`views/LocalVolViewer.tsx`
  + `state/useAffine.ts` + `LocalVolHeatmap.tsx` nodal σ heatmap +
  `LocalVolSmile.tsx` reconstructed-smile-vs-quotes chart): vertex-grid /
  roughness controls, per-expiry fit + butterfly (min φ) diagnostics, arb-free
  badge. 6 API tests; verified end-to-end in headless Edge (ALPHA: arb-free,
  21 bp max error, 4×8 vertex heatmap, 0.5 s fit).

- **Realism leftovers done (2026-06-13)**: the last [REQ] bullet is closed.
  * **Dividend ex-date markers in the Term view**: POST /term now returns a
    `dividends` list (`DividendMarker`: exDate, real-time t, dilated tau,
    amount) for the ticker's discrete schedule within the curve range, emitted
    only under the discrete/mixed dividend modes (`api/analytics.py`
    `_dividend_markers`). TermChart draws them as emerald dashed verticals with
    a $amount label on both the real-time and event-dilated clocks (the
    per-expiry forward already drops across each ex-date; these are
    informational). 3 API tests.
  * **Dividend-schedule editor**: new `DividendEditor.tsx` embedded in the
    ForwardPanel — a mode picker (continuous / discrete cash / discrete
    proportional / mixed), an editable (ex-date, amount) row list with
    add/remove, and the mixed-mode switch horizon. ForwardPanel now PUTs the
    full MarketSettings (mode + schedule + switchYears, not just r/q), so the
    smile refits via the forwards version. Verified end-to-end in headless
    Edge (cash dividend → Term marker at t≈0.12y; editor shows the schedule).

**Next up (in order):**
1. Phase 10 follow-ups still open (scenario auto-seed from dynamicsRegime/ssr +
   lit/dark now done): `enforceCalendar` on the per-view paths, `varSwapEnabled`
   hiding the var-swap rows, `autoLoadPrior`; then the two stubs (auto-on-demand
   calibration trigger, real-time spot streaming).
2. Phase 9 hardening: arbitrage invariants as property tests, fuzzed quote
   sets, provider-failure injection; UX polish (skeletons, error surfaces,
   layout persistence); Docker-compose packaging + user/API docs.
3. Smaller leftovers scattered in the phase checklists: DuckDB/Parquet history
   (the columnar quote-snapshot store, deferred when the providers landed);
   process-pool for parallel slice fits; editable ATM handles + prior load/diff
   UI.
4. Universe leftovers (small): Bloomberg/Massive `available_expiries` now exist;
   the expiry picker is still per-ticker (no cross-ticker "apply to all" yet).

**Environment notes:**
- venv at repo root `.venv`; run tests: `cd backend; ..\.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest tests -q`
  (334 green as of 2026-06-14, incl. 4 perf-budget tests; opt-in live Yahoo
  test via `$env:VOLFIT_LIVE="1"`). Run only perf: `pytest -m perf -s`.
- Data sources: `restart.ps1` registers ALL feeds and auto-picks the best
  reachable as active; switch live via the TopBar **Data Source** selector
  (status light per source). Force one active on launch with
  `-Live`/`-Bloomberg`/`-Massive`/`-Synthetic`. Set `$env:VOLFIT_MASSIVE_KEY`
  to light up Massive (else it shows Red; the rest still work). Bloomberg needs
  an open Terminal (xbbg+blpapi are in .venv).
- API server: `.venv\Scripts\python backend\serve.py` (uvicorn :8000, CORS for
  Vite). Live data: set `$env:VOLFIT_PROVIDER='yahoo'` and
  `$env:VOLFIT_TICKERS='SPY,QQQ,AAPL'` first (yfinance installed).
- Snapshot CLI: `.venv\Scripts\python backend\snapshot.py SPY QQQ` → SQLite
  (`backend/data/snapshots.sqlite`, gitignored) + parity-forward diagnostics.
- Frontend: `cd frontend; npm run dev` — talks to :8000 when up, else mock
  fallback with an amber MOCK badge; `npm run build` is the strict-TS gate.
- Engine demo: `.venv\Scripts\python backend\demo.py`.
- PyPI is **intermittently flaky** on this machine (TLS resets toward Fastly;
  npm/Cloudflare fine). pip is configured with retries=15 in pip.ini — installs
  succeed with patience. Suspected AV/router TLS filtering.
- Sub-agents have no shell access here: they write code, the lead runs/verifies.
- UI smoke-testing recipe: `npm i --no-save puppeteer-core` in frontend, drive
  headless Edge (`C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application\msedge.exe`)
  against the Vite dev server, screenshot and inspect; delete the throwaway
  driver script afterwards.

**Tech decisions** (answering the open questions in CLAUDE.md):

| Question | Recommendation | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Front-end | **React + TypeScript + Vite**, Plotly.js (charts) + Sienna/visx or regl for graph view | Mature, fast iteration, professional look with Tailwind + Radix; nothing materially better for this use case |
| Storage | **SQLite for app state** (universes, fits, priors, graph configs) + **Parquet via DuckDB for quote history** | SQLite is perfect for transactional app data; columnar Parquet/DuckDB is far better for bulk option-chain snapshots and backtests |
| Compute | **NumPy vectorized + Numba JIT** for hot loops (LQD quadrature, graph solves via `scipy.sparse` + CHOLMOD/`sksparse`), optional JAX later for autodiff gradients | "Lightning-fast" target: one slice fit < 50 ms, full surface < 1 s, graph update on 10k nodes < 1 s |
| API | **FastAPI + WebSockets** | Async, pydantic schemas shared with frontend via OpenAPI codegen |

---

## Phase 0 — Foundations (week 1)

- [x] Git init, `pyproject.toml` (setuptools), pytest; frontend scaffold (Vite + TS + Tailwind v4). (ruff configured, mypy not yet)
- [x] CI: lint (ruff) + unit/golden tests + perf budgets + frontend build
  (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). Type-check (mypy) still TODO.
- [x] Shared conventions: ≤400-line files, module docstrings referencing Doc equation numbers (established in code).
- [x] React shell with tab routing (Smile / Term Structure / Graph); FastAPI skeleton pending (deps installed late due to network).

**Exit criteria:** `make dev` runs backend + frontend hot-reload; CI green.

## Phase 1 — Quant core: pricing & LQD slice engine (weeks 2–4)

The LQD note (`Docs/lqd_model_note.tex`) is the centerpiece; implement it first
since other models are standard.

- [x] `core/black.py`: normalized Black formula B(k,w), vega, robust implied-variance inversion (Brent; closed-form ATM).
- [x] `models/lqd/basis.py`: Legendre recursion, endpoint scales A_L/A_R, Lee slopes.
- [x] `models/lqd/quadrature.py`: logit quadrature, martingale shift μ, asset-share A(z), analytic tail corrections (NumPy-vectorized; Numba not needed — slice fit ≈ 30 ms).
- [x] Pricing via cubic-Hermite interpolation on exact nodal derivatives (`models/lqd/interp.py`) — required for clean FD Greeks; density/quantile extraction in `LQDSlice`.
- [x] `models/lqd/atm.py` exact ATM functionals + `models/lqd/ortho.py` (Jacobian, least-norm primary directions, kernel shape modes, exact Newton retargeting).
- [x] `models/lqd/calibrate.py`: vega-weighted LSQ, A_R barrier, n^{2r} regularization, logistic initializer. (wing-aware & quantile-projection initializers still TODO)
- [x] Golden tests: both note benchmarks reproduced (μ to 4e-8; SVI fit < 2 vol bp; double-hat bimodal).

**Exit criteria:** both paper benchmarks reproduced to stated accuracy; slice fit < 50 ms.

## Phase 2 — Quant core: remaining models & no-arbitrage (weeks 4–6)

- [x] `models/svi_jw/`: raw-SVI + JW conversion (Appendix A) + **own
  calibration** (`calibrate.py`: reparametrized LM, data-driven init, soft Lee
  wing-slope & min-variance penalties; recovers the benchmark to machine
  precision). (full Gatheral–Jacquier butterfly conditions still TODO)
- [x] `models/sigmoid/`: 4-param sigmoid curve + LM fit (round-trip exact).
- [x] `models/localvol/`: bilinear (continuous piecewise-affine) and pw-const-in-t grid variants; CN Dupire forward PDE pricer (Rannacher startup, adaptive span); Dupire extraction with butterfly-gated denominator; round-trip + consistency tests. Exposed via the API (GET /localvol extraction + POST /fit/affine direct calibration) and the Local Vol view.
- [x] [REQ 2026-06-12] Local-vol calibration per `Docs/piecewise_affine_local_variance_calibration.tex`: `models/localvol/affine.py` + `affine_calib.py`, golden tests vs every table of the note (Delaunay triangulation is the note's convention; lambda=50 roughness reproduces the calibrated nodal table). **Exposed via the API** (POST /fit/affine/{ticker}, `api/affine_fit.py`) and the **Local Vol frontend view** (direct surface fit + reconstructed arbitrage-free smiles + no-arb diagnostics).
- [x] [REQ 2026-06-12] American-options handling, de-Americanization first: `core/american.py` CRR binomial + `deamericanize()` scalar and `deamericanize_batch()` (vectorized bisection, chain-scale). **Wired into quote prep**: `ChainSnapshot.exercise_style` flag (Yahoo heuristic + VolStore v2), EEP stripped from bid/mid/ask in `api/quotes.py`, carry from the resolved forward.
- [x] Common `SmileModel` protocol (`models/base.py`): `implied_w(k)`, `implied_vol(k, t)` — satisfied by LQD/SVI/sigmoid. (richer `density()`/`diagnostics()` surface TBD)
- [x] Calendar check via G_i(α) ≤ G_j(α): implemented as elementwise asset-share comparison on the shared logit grid (`calib/calendar.py`), soft-slack penalty in `calibrate_slice`, **toggleable**. (model-free butterfly check for non-LQD models TODO)
- [x] `calib/event_time.py`: dilated clock + variance-lumping term-structure interpolation; toggleable.
- [x] Surface construction: sequential nearest-to-farthest with warm starts and violation diagnostics (`calib/surface.py`).

**Exit criteria:** all 4 model families fit a test surface; arbitrage diagnostics (A_L, A_R, Lee slopes, μ, calendar residuals) reported for every fit.

## Phase 3 — Data layer (weeks 5–7, parallel with Phase 2)

- [x] Provider interface `OptionChainProvider` + deterministic `SyntheticProvider` (offline dev/tests) + `yahoo.py` (yfinance, lazy import, injectable factory, sqrt-time expiry thinning) + **`bloomberg.py`** (xbbg, OPT_CHAIN descriptor parse for cheap `available_expiries`, bulk `bdp` for the selected expiries, real `OPT_EXER_TYP` exercise style, `DVD_HIST_ALL` dividend import w/ forward projection) + **`massive.py`** (Massive/Polygon REST, contracts-reference expiries, chain snapshot quotes/greeks/IV, `NOT_AUTHORIZED` -> clear upgrade error, `iv_surface` overlay). Shared field coercion in `data/fieldmap.py`. Both live-verified.
- [x] Implied forwards by put-call parity regression (`data/forwards.py`, recovers F to <0.1% on synthetic).
- [x] [REQ 2026-06-12] Dividends model selection: continuous yield, discrete absolute (escrowed), discrete proportional, or mixed (absolute short-dated switching to proportional long-dated — standard desk practice) — `data/dividends.py`, feeds the theoretical forward. **Discrete schedule editable in the UI** (DividendEditor in the ForwardPanel) and **ex-dates surfaced as markers in the Term view** (event-time clock).
- [x] [REQ 2026-06-12] Forward fitting mode per expiry: **theoretical** (spot + carry from rate/dividend model), **parity-implied** (default), or **manually adjusted** (ForwardPanel UI override, held on AppState with a forwards version in fit keys); GET /forwards/{ticker} shows the three side by side.
- [x] [REQ 2026-06-12] Fit time-series scaffold: every calibration persists (params, ATM handles, diagnostics) keyed by snapshot timestamp into VolStore `fits` (`api/history.py`, opt-in via VOLFIT_DB) + GET /history/{ticker}/{tenorDays}; charting UI deferred.
- [x] Quote prep: mid/bid/ask + haircut modes, spread-based weights, 4-sd wing filter (`volfit/api/quotes.py`). (per-quote liquidity haircuts and richer outlier rules TODO)
- [x] Storage: SQLite `VolStore` (instruments, snapshots, quotes, fits, priors, universes; WAL, versioned schema). Parquet/DuckDB history TODO.
- [x] Universe dataclass + persistence, **now wired to the API and a dedicated
  Universe tab** (add/remove tickers via provider symbol search, save/load named
  universes). AppState holds the mutable active set.
- [x] [REQ 2026-06-12] Expiries bulk selection by type: `data/expiries.py` classification (`expiryType` on /universe) + class filter chips in the Smile header. (Full provider-driven universe-selection UI still TODO.)

**Exit criteria:** one command snapshots a 20-ticker universe from Yahoo into storage; forwards implied; quotes ready for calibration.

## Phase 4 — Graph extrapolation engine (weeks 7–10)

Direct implementation of `Docs/ot_bayesian_graph_extrapolation_expanded.tex`.
Nodes = smiles `(underlying, T)`; node scalar field = smile parameters in
**ATM-orthogonal coordinates** (level w₀, skew s₀, curvature κ₀, shape modes ξ)
— this is what makes the LQD ATM orthogonalization load-bearing: each
coordinate is propagated as its own graph signal `z = x¹ − x⁰`.

- [x] `graph/build.py`: node registry, row-normalized K, stationary π (dense solve), reversibilized conductances. (default-weight rules from sector/maturity proximity TODO)
- [x] `graph/operators.py`: L_rev, L_dir, mobility Laplacian A_ρ (log + arithmetic means).
- [x] `graph/prior.py`: Q_Δ = D_κ + ηL_dir + λ(A_ρ+νI)⁻¹ — **dense path** (fine to ~2k nodes; matrix-free/sparse deferred to Phase 9).
- [x] `graph/posterior.py`: covariance-form update, marginal precisions 1/K⁺_ii. (Hutchinson/selected-inverse large-N path deferred)
- [x] `graph/hyper.py`: marginal likelihood ℓ(θ) (Cholesky), standardized residuals ζ_i. (analytic gradient + auto-tune optimizer TODO)
- [x] Round trip (`graph/smile_universe.py`): handles (atm_vol, skew, curv) propagated per-coordinate → exact ATM retargeting → arbitrage-free LQD smiles + credible bands. Tuning insight: η such that smoothness residual ≈ 1/3 of increment scale gives ~75% same-ticker / ~6% cross-ticker propagation.
- [ ] Validation harness: hide x% of liquid smiles, extrapolate, score vs truth; calibration plots. (basic version exists in tests; systematic harness TODO)

**Exit criteria:** 6-node running example of the note reproduced exactly (μ⁺, π⁺ tables); 1k-node synthetic universe updates < 1 s; held-out validation report.

## Phase 5 — Backend API (weeks 9–11)

- [x] Routers: `/universe`, `/smiles/{ticker}/{expiry}` (fit_mode=mid/bidask/haircut, prior save), `/fit/surface` (POST + WS per-expiry progress), `/graph/solve`, `/scenario/ssr`, `/smiles/{t}/{e}/edits|undo|redo`.
- [x] Fit session model: edited quote set per smile (exclude/include/amend/reset), bounded undo/redo, version-stamped fit cache (`api/session.py`).
- [x] Var-swap level computation per slice (exact integral; in `SmileDiagnostics.varSwapVol`).
- [ ] Performance: process-pool for parallel slice fits across expiries/assets; cache quadrature grids. (in-process fit cache exists; pool TODO)

**Exit criteria:** full fit-edit-refit loop driveable from HTTP/WS; OpenAPI schema published for frontend codegen.

## Phase 6 — Smile Viewer frontend (weeks 10–14)

Professional, commercial, sleek (dark theme default, dense layouts, keyboard-first).

- [x] Smile chart (pure SVG, zero deps): prior vs current vs bid/ask I-beams, log-moneyness axis (fixed-strike mode designed in via `axisMode` prop), strike-range brush, crosshair readout. **Wired to live fits** via `useSmile` (universe selectors, fit-mode refetch, mock fallback when backend offline).
- [x] Quote interaction: click to select, Del to exclude/restore, arrow-key mid amend, Ctrl+Z/Y undo/redo; fit-to-bid-ask / mid / haircut toggle; instant refit on edit (~30 ms server-side). (drag-to-amend TODO if wanted)
- [x] Quantile-function & LQD density chart: prior vs current (`DistributionChart`, GET /smiles/{t}/{e}/density).
- [x] Term-structure view: vol and total variance vs T, calendar in real time **and** event-dilated time; event markers editable (POST /term).
- [ ] Diagnostics panel: A_L/A_R, Lee slopes, var-swap level shown; directly *editable* ATM handles (w₀, s₀, κ₀ via exact retargeting) TODO.
- [x] Prior management: save current fit as prior (button + PriorRecord with params); load/diff UI TODO.
- [x] Hyperparameter panel: **model choice** (LQD/SVI/sigmoid overlays, the
  N/damping knobs grey out off LQD), Legendre N, penalty coefficients.
  (arbitrage/event toggles in the panel still TODO)
- [x] [REQ 2026-06-12] Strike-axis modes on the smile chart: all six modes via `lib/axisModes.ts` (geometry stays in k-space; ticks/crosshair labels transform; delta inverted numerically).
- [x] [REQ 2026-06-12] 3D vol-surface chart: `SurfaceChart.tsx` zero-dep SVG mesh (painter-sorted quads, drag-rotate, colormap) on GET /surface/{ticker}.
- [x] [REQ 2026-06-12] Table export: GET /smiles/{t}/{e}/table + /table.csv attachment; QuoteTable grid view with Copy-TSV and CSV-download.

**Exit criteria:** trader workflow demo — load universe, inspect smile, drag ATM skew, erase a bad quote, refit, save prior — all fluid.

## Phase 7 — Graph Viewer frontend (weeks 13–16)

- [x] Graph visualization: structured SVG lattice (ticker columns × expiry rows, calendar + cross-ticker edges) — chosen over force-directed for legibility at current scale; WebGL/pan-zoom deferred to large-universe work.
- [x] Node states: **lit** (observed) vs **dark** (extrapolated), toggled by click or **lasso** (drag-rectangle lights all enclosed nodes), with per-node dAtmVol inputs. (ticker/expiry filters TODO)
- [x] Edge-weight input: calendar (same-ticker) and cross-ticker weight overrides in SolverPanel (rebuild only the cheap graph, fits cached). (per-edge matrix editor + sector rules + CSV upload TODO)
- [x] Solver panel: κ, η, λ, ν controls (SolverPanel.tsx) + leave-one-out "Auto-tune η" with a scored-grid readout. (live re-solve on every drag still manual via Solve; per-edge κ/λ TODO)
- [x] Result overlay: posterior shift as diverging node color, marginal sd as halo size/fade, hover tooltip with base→post + credible band; double-click → jump to that smile in the Smile Viewer.

**Exit criteria:** end-to-end demo — observe 5 smiles, light them, solve, watch 200 dark smiles update with uncertainty, drill into any one.

## Phase 8 — Vol-spot dynamics & scenarios (weeks 15–17)

- [x] `dynamics/ssr.py`: SSR on ATM vol, configurable; sticky-moneyness / sticky-strike / sticky-local-vol (SSR=2 short-maturity rule) regimes with exact shape-preservation invariant. (true sticky-local-vol-grid mode awaits the localvol model)
- [x] Frontend: regime selector + spot-shift slider with live re-render of shifted smile (ScenarioPanel + dotted overlay).

**Exit criteria:** spot ±5% scenario renders all three regimes consistently for any fitted surface.

## Phase 9 — Hardening, performance & polish (weeks 17–20)

- [x] Perf pass: budget table (`tests/test_perf.py`) enforced in the CI `perf` job — slice fit, local-vol forward solve, 1k-node graph update, de-Am batch. (Profiling-driven Numba/JAX tuning not needed yet; all paths inside budget.)
- [ ] Test depth: arbitrage invariants as property tests (every LQD iterate butterfly-free; calendar residuals ≤ τ), fuzzed quote sets, provider failure injection.
- [ ] UX polish: loading/skeleton states, error surfaces, layout persistence, theming, onboarding tour.
- [ ] Packaging: Docker compose (backend + frontend), one-line local install; user guide + API docs.

## Phase 10 — Workspace restructuring: tabs, Forwards & Options (SHIPPED 2026-06-14)

> Shipped — see the dated STATUS entry at the top for what landed. The checklist
> below is the original plan; the only deferred items are the deeper "wire
> cheap" consumers (scenario auto-seed, enforceCalendar/varSwap per-view,
> autoLoadPrior) and the two stubs, now tracked as Phase 10 follow-ups in
> "Next up".

Reorganize the top-level tabs and consolidate the global / meta controls into a
single **Options** workspace, so the per-workspace asides only carry the live
controls a trader touches per node. No new quant math — this is an
information-architecture + settings-plumbing phase that surfaces engine switches
that already exist (and stubs the two that do not yet).

**Decisions locked in the 2026-06-14 planning Q&A (do not re-litigate):**
- **Options is hybrid**: it holds meta/UX + *defaults* + the penalty catalogue.
  The Parametric aside keeps only the live per-node controls (model, fit-mode,
  scenario). The Forward / Dividend panels *leave* the aside for a dedicated
  Forwards tab.
- **Wiring scope = "wire cheap, stub new."** Wire the toggles that map to an
  existing engine switch now (calendar/arb-fix, event-time dilation, var-swap,
  quote weighting, fit-mode + haircut, dynamics regime + SSR, all defaults).
  **Stub** the genuinely new ones as persisted UI state with a clear TODO:
  *auto-on-demand calibration* and *real-time spot streaming*.
- **auto-on-demand calibration** = a toggle between auto-refit on every edit
  (default ON, today's behavior) and a manual **Calibrate** button that gates
  refits (OFF). **Real-time / static spot** = stream live spot and re-price
  (real-time) vs freeze spot at load (static); pairs with the existing As-of
  selector. Both are stubbed this phase (UI + persisted flag; behavior TODO).
- **Local Vol sub-tabs mirror Parametric**, every view derived from the
  calibrated piecewise-affine LV surface (new backend derivations).
- **sticky-delta** maps to the existing `sticky_moneyness` regime (delta-space ≈
  moneyness-space); the UI labels it "sticky-delta", the `Regime` enum is
  unchanged (`sticky_moneyness` | `sticky_strike` | `sticky_local_vol`).

**Top-level tabs (before → after):**
```
before:  Smile · Term Structure · Local Vol · Graph · Universe
after:   Parametric · Local Vol · Forwards · Options · Graph · Universe
```
Term Structure ceases to be a top tab (it becomes a Parametric/Local-Vol
sub-tab). `App.tsx` `TabId`/`TABS` updated; `TopBar` unchanged structurally.

### 10A — Parametric workspace (rename Smile → Parametric, embed Term)
- [ ] Rename the tab **label** to "Parametric" (`App.tsx`). Keep the `smile`
  route id and `SmileViewer` component to minimize churn (or rename to
  `parametric` if cheap — label is what the user sees).
- [ ] Chart-card sub-tabs become **Smile · Density · Log Q-density · Term ·
  Surface · Table** — i.e. embed Term-Structure *alongside Density*. Add a
  `term` case to `ChartView` + `VIEW_HINTS` in `SmileViewer.tsx`; render
  `TermChart` (existing) in the chart body for the current ticker.
- [ ] Move the Term-Structure controls (event markers + real-time/dilated-clock
  toggle + expiry ladder table from `TermStructureViewer.tsx`) into a compact
  **TermControls** aside panel shown only when the Term sub-tab is active
  (mirrors how the strike-axis `select` shows only for the Smile view). The
  global Events ON/OFF *default* lives in Options; live per-session event
  editing stays here.
- [ ] Retire the standalone `TermStructureViewer.tsx` top-level view (its parts
  are reused: `TermChart` in the sub-tab, the controls in TermControls).
- [ ] Slim the aside (`SmileAside.tsx`) to **diagnostics + live model/fit-mode +
  scenario** only; remove `ForwardPanel` (→ Forwards tab) and the
  defaults-y knobs of `HyperparamPanel` (→ Options). Keep a minimal live
  model + fit-mode selector seeded from the Options defaults.

### 10B — Local Vol workspace (model-aware sub-tabs, derived from the LV surface)
- [ ] Add Parametric-style chart-card sub-tabs to `LocalVolViewer.tsx`:
  **Smile (reconstructed) · Density · Term · Surface (heatmap) · Table**, every
  view derived from the calibrated piecewise-affine local-vol surface (the
  existing `POST /fit/affine/{ticker}` result), not from the LQD backbone.
- [ ] Backend derivations from the cached affine fit (each ≤ 400 lines, new
  helpers next to `api/affine_fit.py`):
  - **Density**: Breeden–Litzenberger on the reconstructed arbitrage-free call
    prices per expiry (reuse `models/diagnostics.numeric_density` on the
    reconstructed slice).
  - **Term**: ATM vol / total variance / var-swap per expiry from the
    reconstructed smiles (same shape as `POST /term`).
  - **Table**: per-strike reconstructed prices/IVs (same shape as
    `GET /smiles/{t}/{e}/table`).
  Expose either as fields on the affine response or sibling GET endpoints that
  read the per-request affine cache; keep the response under the size policy.
- [ ] Frontend: reuse `DistributionChart` / `TermChart` / `QuoteTable` against
  the LV-derived payloads; the heatmap stays the "Surface" sub-tab.

### 10C — Forwards tab (new top-level, shared by Parametric + Local Vol)
- [ ] New `views/ForwardsViewer.tsx`: a per-ticker **forwards table** across all
  listed expiries (`GET /forwards/{ticker}` already returns every entry) — one
  row per expiry with the parity / theo / active columns and an inline
  mode selector + manual override (`PUT /forwards/{t}/{e}`), plus the
  ticker-level **carry (r/q)** and **dividend schedule** editor (reuse
  `DividendEditor`; `PUT /settings/market/{ticker}`).
- [ ] No engine change: both Parametric and Local Vol already read the active
  forward through the `forwards_version` fit-cache key, so edits here refit both
  workspaces automatically. Removing `ForwardPanel` from the aside is pure UI
  relocation.

### 10D — Options tab (new top-level: meta + defaults + penalties)
A preferences workspace (`views/OptionsViewer.tsx`, split into section
components to stay ≤ 400 lines). Sections:

1. **Calibration defaults** — seed every new fit/ticker/session:
   - Vol-surface model default (LQD / SVI / Sigmoid).
   - LQD: Legendre order N, damping λ + power r.
   - Sigmoid: SIV cores R + the MC-SIV defaults.
   - "Default parameters for LQD and Sigmoid" (initial-guess / bounds presets).
   - Quote weighting scheme (equal | tv_density).
   - Fit mode (Mid / Bid-Ask / Haircut) + Haircut value.
   - Local-vol **grid-size default** (nXNodes, nTNodes) + roughness λ.
   - **Prior default** (auto-load the saved prior as the fit prior on node load,
     on/off + behavior).
2. **Penalty catalogue** — each row: description + coefficient knob + formula +
   source module (formulas verified against the code 2026-06-14):

   | Penalty | Coefficient (knob) | Penalty term | Module |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | LQD high-order damping | `regLambda` λ, `regPower` r | λ · n^{2r} · a_n² (n ≥ 4; modes a₂,a₃ free) | `models/lqd/calibrate.py` |
   | Calendar slack (arb-fix) | `calendar_weight` (1e6) | w · Σ max(floor − Gᵢ(α), 0)² | `calib/calendar.py`, `lqd/calibrate.py` |
   | SVI min-variance | `_PENALTY_WEIGHT` P | P · max(−(a + bσ√(1−ρ²)), 0)² | `models/svi_jw/calibrate.py` |
   | SVI Lee wing | `_PENALTY_WEIGHT` P | P · max(b(1+|ρ|) − 2, 0)² | `models/svi_jw/calibrate.py` |
   | Band hinge + mid anchor | `haircut` h, `MID_ANCHOR_WEIGHT` (0.05) | max(model−ask,0)² + max(bid−model,0)² + 0.05·(model−mid)² | `calib/band.py` |
   | Affine LV roughness | `regLambda` (note λ=50) | √λ · L(θ − θ_ref), L = 2nd diff in (t, x) | `models/localvol/affine_calib.py` |
   | Sigmoid amplitude ridge | `_RIDGE` | ridge · Σ α_r² (hat amplitudes) | `models/sigmoid/calibrate.py` |

   Editable where a coefficient is a real knob (λ, r, haircut, calendar_weight,
   roughness); the others render formula + description read-only.
3. **Toggles — wired this phase** (map to existing engine switches):
   - **Arbitrage fix** ON/OFF → `enforceCalendar` (promote the per-request
     `SurfaceFitRequest.enforceCalendar` to a global default on `AppState`).
   - **Events** ON/OFF default → `eventsEnabled` (promote from
     `TermStructureRequest.eventsEnabled`).
   - **Variance-Swaps** ON/OFF → compute/show the var-swap level + column.
   - **Spot-Vol dynamics** default → regime (sticky-strike / sticky-delta /
     sticky-LV) + **SSR value** (feeds the Scenario panel's default).
4. **Toggles — stubbed this phase** (persisted UI state + behavior TODO):
   - **Auto-on-demand calibration**: auto-refit on edit (ON, current) vs manual
     **Calibrate** button (OFF). Persist the flag; gating behavior is TODO.
   - **Real-time / static spot prices**: stream live spot + re-price vs freeze
     at load. Persist the flag; streaming behavior is TODO (pairs with As-of).

### Backend — global settings plumbing
- [ ] New global **app/meta settings** on `AppState` (extend `FitSettings` or add
  a sibling `OptionsSettings` schema; keep schema files ≤ 400 lines) covering:
  model/N/damping/haircut/weighting (already in `FitSettings`) + grid-size
  default, var-swap on/off, prior default, events default, arb-fix default,
  dynamics regime + SSR default, spot mode (stub), auto-calibration (stub).
- [ ] `GET/PUT /settings/options` (or extend `GET/PUT /settings/fit`); fold the
  fit-affecting fields into the existing **fit-cache version** so every view
  refits consistently (same pattern as `settings_version` / `forwards_version`).
- [ ] Thread the promoted globals (`enforceCalendar`, `eventsEnabled`, var-swap,
  regime/SSR, grid-size) into the surface/term/affine/scenario call sites as the
  *default*, with any live per-node control still overriding.

### Tests & exit criteria
- [ ] Backend: settings round-trip + cache-version bump tests; LV-derived
  density/term/table golden tests (match the Parametric-shape payloads on an
  arbitrage-free affine fit); arb-fix/events/var-swap default propagation tests.
- [ ] Frontend: strict-TS build green; the six top tabs render; Parametric shows
  the Term sub-tab next to Density; Local Vol shows the five derived sub-tabs;
  Forwards edits refit both workspaces; Options persists and refits.
- [ ] Headless-Edge smoke: rename verified (Parametric), Term embedded, Forwards
  table edits a forward end-to-end, Options toggles persist across reload.
- **Exit:** tabs reorganized to Parametric · Local Vol · Forwards · Options ·
  Graph · Universe; Term embedded; Local Vol mirrors Parametric off the LV
  surface; Forwards & dividends live in one shared tab; Options drives all
  defaults/penalties/toggles (two stubbed) with a single global settings round
  trip; all tests green; files ≤ 400 lines.

## Execution policy (per CLAUDE.md)

- **Sub-agents:** parallelize by vertical — quant-core agent, data agent, graph agent, frontend agent — coordinated through the `SmileModel` and API interface contracts frozen at end of Phase 1/5 respectively. Spawn review agents for arbitrage-math correctness on every quant PR.
- **File size:** hard cap 400 lines; split by responsibility (basis/quadrature/pricing/calibrate pattern above).
- **Speed:** every quant function vectorized; benchmarks in CI with regression gates.
- **Comments:** every module gets a header docstring linking to the equation numbers of the relevant Doc note (e.g. "implements eq. (mu_norm) of lqd_model_note").

## Key risks & mitigations

1. **Yahoo scraping fragility** → cache snapshots, provider abstraction, fall back to stored data; treat Bloomberg/Massive as optional plug-ins.
2. **Dividends/forwards quality** → parity-implied forwards first (robust), explicit dividend curves later; sanity-check vs spot-carry.
3. **Graph hyperparameter opacity** → empirical Bayes + held-out ζ calibration baked in from day one (note §9); never ship point estimates without marginal precision.
4. **Local-vol grid arbitrage** → grid model is the hardest to keep arbitrage-free; gate it behind diagnostics and ship it last within Phase 2.
5. **Performance creep in UI** → WebSocket incremental updates, debounced refits, WebGL graph rendering from the start.
