# Graph leave-one-out — findings

## 2026-07-09 — full 25-asset benchmark pack (3 regimes)

The full benchmark pack (`backtest/benchmark_pack.py`, 46,995 scored rows:
25 assets × 19 day pairs × 3 regimes × {full_loo, liquid_split} × R∈{0,1};
artifact `results/benchmark/benchmark_report.html` + `.json`, generated
2026-07-09 01:09). This run had `DARK_BASE_SCALE = 0.25` active (the pilot's
dark-precision follow-up) and the full 25-asset edge set live: index→name
(β 0.7, w 2), same-sector name↔name (β 0.6, w 2), calendar (w 10). No US
sector ETF is captured, so ETF→name stays dormant (EEM/EFA are intl funds).

    name      +0.27 … +0.32  +0.14 … +0.14  +0.25 … +0.32

### Verdict

1. **Neighbour-supported skill is real and concentrates exactly where the
   graph has information: indexes (+11…+76 bp, largest in the spike regime)
   and ETFs (+3…+7 bp).** ζ mean ≈ 0 everywhere; bands conservative on
   indexes/ETFs (ζ std 0.16–0.41 per-kind).
2. **Single names get ~nothing even WITH calendar support (+0.1…+0.3 bp)**,
   and they dominate the row count (~80%), which is why the aggregate
   full_loo skill (+0.3…+6.9 bp) looks so much smaller than the pilot's
   headline (+26…+37 bp — an 8-asset, index/ETF-weighted composition, NOT
   name skill). Name base RMS is enormous (452 bp even in the LOW regime —
   earnings-dominated idiosyncratic moves), and the bands under-state it
   there (name ζ std 1.48 = overconfident in low_jul2023).
3. **The pilot's dark-name null REPLICATES at 25 assets: liquid_split ATM
   skill = 0.000 in all three regimes** (graph RMS = baseline RMS to 3
   decimals). Universe starvation was therefore NOT the cause — same-sector
   name↔name and index→name edges were live this time. **Root cause found
   2026-07-09 (topology bug in the HARNESS edge builder, not a market
   fact):** see the next section.

## 2026-07-09 — liquid_split root cause: one-way cross edges disconnect dark names

A sensitivity sweep (`DARK_BASE_SCALE` 0.25→0.001 × cross conductance ×1→×25,
spike regime, 4 day pairs) produced **exactly zero median dark shift in every
cell** — not damped, disconnected. Diagnosis on one solve (49 lit obs with
median +56 bp ATM innovation, 260 cross edges present in the graph):

- the directed kernel row of a dark AAPL node was healthy (SPX 0.417,
  MSFT 0.417, own calendar 0.083 each), **but the reversibilized conductance
  c_ij = f(π, K) was 0.0 on every edge touching a single name**;
- `backtest/graph_edges.build_directed_edges` emitted cross edges ONE-WAY
  (informer → name; "indices/ETFs receive calendar edges only"), so single
  names are TRANSIENT states of the directed walk: all their mass drains into
  the index/ETF calendar chains and none returns ⇒ stationary mass π = 0 on
  every name ⇒ conductance 0 ⇒ the increment prior fully decouples them.
  `DARK_BASE_SCALE` never mattered: no signal ever arrived. (The pilot's
  measured "96 bp SPX innovation moves dark AAPL 0.01 bp" was this same
  artifact — the baseline-precision explanation was a misdiagnosis.)
- the PRODUCT auto-lattice is unaffected (its cross edges are symmetric, so
  π > 0 everywhere — which is why in-app extrapolation demos propagate).

**Fix (`EdgeConfig.cross_reverse_frac`, default 1.0):** emit the reverse edge
(name informs its index/ETF informer) with the same weight and the INVERSE
beta — both directions then encode the same linear relation, so no second
economic claim is introduced; names become recurrent and their conductance is
nonzero. `cross_reverse_frac=0` reproduces the legacy disconnected topology
(locked in `tests/test_graph_loo_backtest.py`). Note: name↔name same-sector
edges were already bidirectional, but could not help — the whole name cluster
drained one-way into the index chains.

Consequence: **every liquid_split row in the benchmark pack (pilot + 25-asset)
was produced under the disconnected topology and is void as a test of
cross-asset extrapolation.** full_loo index/ETF results flow through calendar
edges within recurrent chains and stand.

### Post-fix sensitivity sweep (spike, 4 day pairs, 799 dark name-nodes/cell)

Grid: η ∈ {1, 10} × cross-conductance ×{1, 5, 25} × DARK_BASE_SCALE
∈ {0.25, 0.05, 0.01}, liquid_split, R ∈ {0, 1}. Headline rows (ATM, bp):

Findings:

1. **DARK_BASE_SCALE is a dead lever**: shifts and skill are IDENTICAL across
   0.25 / 0.05 / 0.01 (only ζ moves in the 2nd decimal via the band). The
   binding constraints are reach η and edge conductance — the baseline
   precision never was the bottleneck, post-fix or pre-fix.
2. **Dark-name skill is real but small once the topology is fixed: +1.7…+4.9
   bp (R-bracket) at the strongest tested cell (η 10 × cross ×25)**, monotone
   in both η and cross weight with no overshoot in the tested range.
3. **The ceiling is signal-to-noise, not plumbing**: single-name day-over-day
   ATM moves run ~650 bp RMS on these spike pairs while the propagated
   (β-scaled, damped) index innovation delivers ~20 bp median shift — the
   graph can only harvest the systematic sliver of a name's move. Bands are
   modestly overconfident on names (ζ std 1.2–1.4).

**Net:** cross-asset extrapolation to fully-dark names WORKS mechanically
after the reverse-edge fix and adds genuine-but-modest skill in stress; its
honest product claim is "keeps dark names marked and moving with the market,
with stated uncertainty" — not "predicts single-name vol". The void
liquid_split rows were STRIPPED from the `results/benchmark/` parts
(originals archived in `void_liquid_pre_topofix/`) and the full liquid_split
benchmark was RE-RUN under the fixed topology.

## 2026-07-09 — liquid_split resweep (fixed topology, η 10 × cross ×25)

Full 3-regime resweep (user's window; parts `*_topofix_eta10.json`; command:
`-m backtest.benchmark_pack run --designs liquid_split --eta 10
--cross-mult 25 --tag _topofix_eta10`, then `report`). η 10 / cross ×25 were
TUNED ON SPIKE (the sensitivity sweep's strongest cell); high_oct2022 and
low_jul2023 are therefore out-of-sample for the knob choice. Dark single
names only, ~3.4–3.7k scores per regime × R:

    regime         R    n     atmGr   atmBs    atmSk   med|shift|  zMean   zStd
    spike_aug2024  0  3419    489.5   503.7   +14.15      10.4    -0.01   1.10

    low_jul2023    0  3536    451.6   452.3    +0.67       4.2    -0.04   1.91
    low_jul2023    1  3536    452.0   452.8    +0.78       3.4    -0.06   1.85

### Final verdict on cross-asset extrapolation to fully-dark names

1. **Real, quotable skill in stressed regimes**: +7.9…+14.2 bp on the spike
   (in-sample for the knobs, but the skill is 3× the sensitivity-sweep
   preview once the crash/snapback days enter) and **+3.8…+7.2 bp
   out-of-sample on high_oct2022**, with unbiased, honest-to-conservative
   bands (ζ std 0.70–1.10).
2. **~Nothing in the calm regime** (+0.7 bp on low_jul2023): single-name
   moves there are earnings/idiosyncratic, the systematic component the graph
   can carry is negligible — and the bands are markedly OVERCONFIDENT there
   (ζ std ~1.9). Skill is never negative in any cell: propagation never
   hurts, it just can't manufacture idiosyncratic information.
3. **Follow-up (band honesty in calm tape):** dark-name posterior uncertainty
   should widen when the name's own regime is idiosyncratic (e.g. an
   event/earnings-aware term in the dark baseline precision, or a per-kind ζ
   recalibration) — ζ std 1.9 in low_jul2023 is the one dishonest cell in
   the pack.

**Product framing this supports:** graph propagation to fully-dark names
earns its keep exactly when the desk needs it — when the market reprices
together — adding up to ~14 bp of ATM accuracy over mechanical transport in
stress, never subtracting in calm; uncertainty is honest in stress and needs
an idiosyncratic-regime widening in calm tape.

## 2026-07-10 — idio band floor closes the calm-regime overconfidence (SHIPPED)

The follow-up above is implemented as a **band floor from the node's own
trailing unexplained move** (`volfit/graph/idio.py`, wired into the shared
`solve()` so production, the in-app LOO and this harness all exercise it):

    sd_atm'^2 = max(sd_atm^2, 0.30 * sigma_I^2)

`sigma_I` = shrunk EWMA-RMS (half-life 5 trading days, shrink k=4 toward the
cross-sectional pool) of the ticker's past ATM innovations vs the transported
prior, pooled across expiries, STRICTLY causal (cold start ⇒ no floor ⇒
byte-identical legacy field). Key mechanics: a dark node's baseline precision
enters ONLY its band variance (never the posterior mean — `posterior.py`'s
`1/p0` term is absent from the mean's observed columns), so the floor is
mean-invariant by construction; production records lit-node innovations at
every solve (`AppState.record_graph_innovations`, persisted) and floors a
node from the days it was lit; the harness accumulates the same quantity
across day pairs (`graph_loo._idio_sigma_map`), with `benchmark_pack` seeding
each chunk from earlier same-tag parts so chunked runs match a single process.

**Design + validation were OFFLINE on the stored rows** (band-only ⇒ stored
residuals stay exact; `zeta' = -res_atm / sqrt(var' + 1/r)` with `1/r`
recovered from the stored `zeta`/`sd`/`res_atm`). Sweep over rule ∈
{additive, floor} × λ ∈ {0.25…1.0} × half-life {3, 5, flat}: additive
widening degrades the honest stress cells; the floor at λ=0.30 is surgical.
Shipped-estimator replay on the resweep parts (dark names, η10×cross25):

    regime         R    zStd before -> after   floor binds
    low_jul2023    0        1.91 -> 1.02          12.5%
    low_jul2023    1        1.85 -> 1.03          12.9%
    spike_aug2024  0        1.10 -> 0.99          26.2%
    spike_aug2024  1        1.02 -> 0.94          18.7%
    high_oct2022   0        0.78 -> 0.77           0.8%
    high_oct2022   1        0.70 -> 0.70           0.8%

ζ means stay unbiased (drift ≤ 0.06). full_loo cells improve the same way
(low-regime names 1.48 → 0.87). The floor **self-gates across asset kinds**
(index/ETF trailing innovations are small, so their already-conservative
bands are essentially untouched, binds ≈ 0%) — no asset taxonomy or regime
input needed, which is what makes it production-clean. Posterior means and
ATM skill are UNCHANGED everywhere by construction; `GraphExtrapolateRequest.
idioFloor=false` restores legacy bands exactly. Contracts locked in
`tests/test_graph_idio.py` (11 tests). Follow-up: skew/curvature band
widening rides the full handle-covariance work (roadmap R3).

# Pilot findings (2026-06-26, 8 assets, spike only) — historical

Temporal validation of the graph smile-extrapolator (`backtest/graph_loo.py`,
roadmap Phase 6) over the captured **spike_aug2024** regime (8 assets, 18
consecutive day pairs, 4134 scored held-out nodes, 0 pairs skipped). Method: freeze
T-1's surface as the active prior, transport under SSR R, propagate the lit
innovation `d = calibrated_T − transported_prior` through the directed graph, and
compare the held-out node's graph posterior with its ACTUAL day-T calibration —
versus the pure transported-prior baseline (the **skill**: does the graph beat the
mechanical spot-transport?). Lit calibration runs in mode `off` (pure market), so
the innovation is the genuine market-vs-prior move.

`atmGr/atmBs` = graph vs baseline ATM-vol residual RMS (bp); `atmSk` = skill (base −
graph, **positive ⇒ graph wins**); `wGr/wBs` = reconstructed full-smile wing RMS
(bp); ζ = standardized residual (well-specified ⇒ N(0,1)).

    design          R    n    atmGr   atmBs   atmSk    wGr     wBs    zMean   zStd
    full_loo        0  1497  277.0   314.1   +37.1    97.9   104.5   -0.01   0.90
    full_loo        1  1497  222.1   247.7   +25.6   112.6   115.2   -0.01   0.72
    liquid_split    0   570  369.3   369.3    +0.0   108.6   104.3   +0.00   1.16

## Verdict

1. **The graph adds large, robust skill when a held-out node has lit neighbours
   (`full_loo`): +26 to +37 bp ATM, +3 to +7 bp wing.** This is the "fill a
   temporarily-missing / sparse node from its calendar + cross-asset neighbours" use
   case, and the graph clearly beats the transported prior. The uncertainty is
   well-calibrated: **ζ mean ≈ 0 (unbiased)** and ζ std 0.72–0.90 (slightly
   conservative). The win is driven mainly by the strong CALENDAR coupling.

2. **The SSR sweep brackets the skill, exactly as posed (Q1).** R=0
   (sticky-moneyness) leaves an underperformer's baseline vol unmoved → larger
   residual AND larger apparent skill (+37); R=1 (sticky-strike) pre-absorbs the
   leverage → smaller residual and smaller skill (+26). The genuine graph value sits
   **between +26 and +37 bp ATM**; both are reported rather than committing to one R.

3. **Cross-asset extrapolation to FULLY-dark names (`liquid_split`) adds ~nothing on
   this pilot — ATM skill ≈ 0, wing slightly negative.** Two compounding reasons,
   both measured:
   - the transported prior is already an excellent SAME-name predictor and enters at
     very high baseline precision (`[1e6,1e6,1e4]`), so a dark node stays glued to it;
     a single weak cross-asset index edge can't move it (verified: a 96 bp SPX
     innovation shifts the dark AAPL node by 0.01 bp);
   - the 8-asset pilot is **structurally starved** of cross-asset edges — no US sector
     ETF, and AAPL/NVDA/JPM share no sector, so the `name→name` and `SectorETF→name`
     edge classes are **dormant**. Only Index→name (one weak edge per name) + calendar
     (all dark in this design) are present.

   So this is **not a verdict against cross-asset extrapolation** — the experiment
   can't exercise it. Two concrete follow-ups would give it a fair test:
   - **the 25-asset capture** (same-sector name clusters: tech AAPL/MSFT, semis
     NVDA/AVGO, financials BRK.B/JPM/GS, … + real sector ETFs would light the dormant
     edges);
   - **a lower baseline precision for DARK nodes** in the production graph
     (`graph/precision.py`): a dark extrapolation target is inherently less certain
     than a lit observed prior, so its baseline should not pin the posterior — let the
     propagated signal express. (A production change; validate on the 25-asset data.)

**Net:** the graph extrapolator is empirically validated for neighbour-supported
nodes (large, well-calibrated skill) on the spike regime; the fully-dark cross-asset
case is inconclusive on the pilot and needs the 25-asset capture + a dark-node
precision revisit. Next: rerun across `high_oct2022` / `low_jul2023` for
regime-robustness, then the 25-asset capture.
